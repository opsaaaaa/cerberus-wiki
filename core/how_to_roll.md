How To Roll
===
 
In Cerberus. The rules, equation, and variables for the number of dice you roll will always be the same. Modifiers assists and checks are all optional, I recommend ignoring them for the players fist handful of rolls.

##The Roll Equation
Base **+** Attribute or Class **+** Skill or Proficiency **+** Modifiers **+** Assist or Check

| Variable | Rule |
|---:|:---|
**Base** | Base is always **3** dice, unless house rules say otherwise.
**Attribute** | An **Attribute** can range from -1-4 dice and is chosen based on the skill being rolled.
**Class** | A player may choose to use a **class** instead of a attribute, so long as the skill is applicable to the class.
**Skill** | A Skill can range from -1-4 dice and is chosen base on the task at hand. For example if the player is ridding a horse they roll **ride / pilot**
**Proficiency** | A Proficiency can be rolled instead of a Skill. Proficiencies range from 0-4 dice. 
**Modifiers** | Modifiers increase or decrease the rolls dice based on the environment, equipment and situation. For example if the character is shooting a bow at range they get an additional 2 dice. If they are in close combat their roll losses two dice. custom modifiers can be created on the spot by the GM. modifiers can add or remove dice or wins from a roll.     
**Assist** | A if the GM dose not require a check for the roll the player can request to assist their roll with another skill. another character may also the roll. only one assist per player is allowed. depending on the outcome of the assist it will either add or remove wins from the role. _[Rolling Assists and Checks][assists and checks]_
**Check** | The GM can require a check. For example if a character is fighting on horseback the gm can require a ride/pilot check in their roll. depending on the outcome of the check it will either add or remove wins from the role. _see Rolling Assists and Checks_

## Rolling Assists and Checks




## Examples:
Fred McFyord is going to attempt to climb the castle wall. 
he has **1** dice in **Grapple** and **2** dice in **Strength**.

The gm decides no modifiers apply and  the player decides not to assist with anything and the gm decides no check is necessary. 
The GM sets the challenge level to **3** ( a specialized task ).

base is always **3** plus his **2** dice for strength plus **1** dice for Grapple. 

The player rolls **6** dice. **2** dice land between **4-5** so the roll has **2** wins.
**2 wins** is less than the challenge level of **3**, so the attempt fails.

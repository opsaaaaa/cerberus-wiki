Cerberus Wiki
=============

Cerberus is a home-brew alteration of the table top role-play rule set, cogent.

The main goal of these alterations is to reduce the complexity in making a roll. The plan is to:

- Remove the distinction between assistable and non-assistable skills.
- Make combat and non-combat rolls consistent.
- Reduce the amount of times a player asks the GM whats the challenge level for an assist.
- Reduce confusion about how to roll.
- Maintain the functionality of cogent.

A secondary goal is to experiment and add new features that turn out to be fun to play with. The intention is to keep new features separate and optional.

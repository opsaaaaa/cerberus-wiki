How To Roll
===========

In Cerberus. The rules and variables involved in the number of dice you roll will always be the same. 

  **Base + Attribute or Class + Skill or Proficiency + ( Modifiers ) + ( Assist or Check )**

Modifiers assists and checks are all optional, I recommend ignoring them for the players fist handful of rolls.

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 20 80

   * - **Base** 
     - Base is 3 dice.
   * - **Attribute**
     - An Attribute is chosen based on the skill being rolled.
   * - **Class**
     - A player may choose to use a **class** instead of a attribute.
   * - **Skill** 
     - A Skill is chosen base on the task at hand. 
   * - **Proficiency** 
     - A Proficiency is a custom skill. 
   * - ( **Modifiers** )
     - Modifiers can add or remove dice or wins from a roll.     
   * - ( **Assist** ) 
     - An Assist add dice but also increases the CL.
   * - ( **Check** )
     - A check is a required assist. 

Attribute and Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A character will have 3 attributes. Each attribute has 4 skills. 
An attribles value can range from **-1 to 4**. 
And a class can range from **0 to 4**.

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 10 10 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Strength**
     - **Reflex**
     - **Intelligence**
   * - Athletics
     - Acrobatics
     - Deception
   * - Grapple
     - Ride / Pilot
     - Persuasion
   * - Swim
     - Sleight of Hand
     - Infiltration
   * - Aim / Throw
     - Stealth
     - Survival

If a player is making a **Sleight of hand** roll, they must use the **Reflex** attribute. Unless the character has a applicable class.

  Joshua has a **class of Rogue**, he is attempting to steal the guards keys.
  his player rolls **Rogue + Sleight of hand**.
  thats **3 base + 2 Rouge + 1 slieght of hand** for a total of **6 die**.

  Joshua's player could have also rolled **Reflex + Slieght of hand** but he only had 1 die in reflex.
   
The classes avaliable are determined my the GM, players, and the setting you are playing in.

  Examples; elf, giant, wizard, water bender, dullahon, monk, sniper, black smith, chef. 

Note that a player can have more than one class.

Skills and Proficiencies

Assists and Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Given the GM's approval A character can assist to their roll with another **skill, proficiency, attribute, or class**. 
A assist just adds the dice from the assistable to your role.
Unless the GM specifies otherwise the assist **adds 1 to** the **challenge level** or the **opponents Avasion or defence**.

  Jean has **3 Grapple**, **0 Strength**, and **2** dice in her **knife combat** proficiency. 
  She is attempting to grab her opponents shirt, pull them in and stab them.
  Jean's player rolls **3 base + 1 Str + 2 knife combat + 3 Grapple**, totaling **9 dice**.
  Her opponents avasion roll is increased from **3** wins to **4**.

Another character my also assist the roll. only one assist per character is allowed and only if the character is not seriously occupied.


A check is basically the same as an assists. the difference is that a check can be required by the GM. and it **adds 2 to the challenge level** instead of 1. 

  Jean is is attempting to jump off her motorbike onto the back of the truck.
  The GM decides a **Ride/Pilot** check is required.
  Her player rolls **3 base + 1 Str + 2 Athletics + -1 Ride/Pilot** totaling **5 dice**
  The challenge level for this roll is increased from **2** to **4**.



Examples:
^^^^^^^^^
  Fred McFyord is going to attempt to climb the castle wall. 
  he has **1** dice in **Grapple** and **2** dice in **Strength**.
  
  The gm decides no modifiers apply and  the player decides not to assist with anything and the gm decides no check is necessary. 
  The GM sets the challenge level to **3** ( a specialized task ).
  
  base is always **3** plus his **2** dice for strength plus **1** dice for Grapple. 
  
  The player rolls **6** dice. **2** dice land between **4-5** so the roll has **2** wins.
  **2 wins** is less than the challenge level of **3**, so the attempt fails.

-----------------------------------------

  Fred McFyord is going to attempt to swim under to the other ship withour being seen. 
  he as **2** dice in **swim** and **2** dice in **strength**.

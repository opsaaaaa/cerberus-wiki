How To Roll
===========

In Cerberus. The rules and variables involved in the number of dice you roll will always be the same. 

**Base + Attribute or Class + Skill or Proficiency + ( Modifiers ) + ( Assist or Check )**

Modifiers assists and checks are all optional, I recommend ignoring them for the players fist handful of rolls.

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 20 80

   * - **Base** 
     - Base is 3 dice.
   * - **Attribute**
     - An Attribute is chosen based on the skill being rolled.
   * - **Class**
     - A player may choose to use a **class** instead of a attribute.
   * - **Skill** 
     - A Skill is chosen base on the task at hand. 
   * - **Proficiency** 
     - A Proficiency is a custom skill. 
   * - ( **Modifiers** )
     - Modifiers can add or remove dice or wins from a roll.     
   * - ( **Assist** ) 
     - An Assist add dice but also increeses the CL.
   * - ( **Check** )
     - A check is a required assist. 

Attribute and Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A character will have 3 attributes. Each attribute has 4 skills.

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 10 10 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Strength**
     - **Reflex**
     - **Inteligence**
   * - Athletics
     - Acrobatics
     - Deception
   * - Grapple
     - Ride / Pilot
     - Persuasion
   * - Swim
     - Sleight of Hand
     - Infiltration
   * - Aim / Throw
     - Stealth
     - Survival

If a player is making a **Sleight of hand** roll, they must use the **Reflex** attribute. Unless the character has a applicable class.

  Joshua has a **class of Rogue**, he is atempting to steal the gaurds keys.
  his player rolls **Rogue + Sleight of hand**.
  thats **3 base + 2 Rouge + 1 slieght of hand** for a total of **6 die**.

  Joshua's player could have also rolled **Reflex + Slieght of hand** but he olny had 1 die in reflex.
   
The classes avaliable are determined my the GM, players, and the setting you are playing in.

  Examples; elf, giant, wizard, water bender, dullahon, munk, sniper, black smith, chef. 

Note that a player can have more than one class.


Assists
^^^^^^^
For example if a character is fighting on horseback the gm can require a ride/pilot check in their roll. depending on the outcome of the check it will either add or remove wins from the role. _[Rolling Checks][rc]_

For example if the player is ridding a horse they roll **ride / pilot**

Given the GM's approval A character can assist a roll with a second skill or proficiency. Another player my also assist the roll with one of their own skill.

A assist is rolled seprately either before or after the player completes the rest of the roll.
Unless otherwise declared by the GM the challenge level for a assist is **3**.

If the wins exceed the **CL** then additional wins are added to the roll. Otherwise you subtrack from the roll the number of wins the assist failed by.

The number of dice you roll for the assist is **Base + Attribute + Skill or Proficiency**. you do not add modifiers to assists.

  Jesse's **survival** is **2** and he is looking for some food to eat. 
  he could assist a **perception** roll with his **survival** skill.
  for his assist, he would roll a **base** of **3** plus **survival** of **2** for a total of **5** die.
  say the assist gets **4** wins, the player adds **1** win to the roll.
  say it gets **1** win, the player remove **2** wins from the roll.

Checks
^^^^^^

rolling a check is similar to [rolling an assist][ra]. The difference is that player can not request a check, its solely up to the GM if a check is required.

  Jesse is trying to sneak past the guards on horseback. So the GM requires jesse's player to add a **ride / pilot** check to his **stealth** roll.


Examples:
^^^^^^^^^
  Fred McFyord is going to attempt to climb the castle wall. 
  he has **1** dice in **Grapple** and **2** dice in **Strength**.
  
  The gm decides no modifiers apply and  the player decides not to assist with anything and the gm decides no check is necessary. 
  The GM sets the challenge level to **3** ( a specialized task ).
  
  base is always **3** plus his **2** dice for strength plus **1** dice for Grapple. 
  
  The player rolls **6** dice. **2** dice land between **4-5** so the roll has **2** wins.
  **2 wins** is less than the challenge level of **3**, so the attempt fails.

-----------------------------------------

  Fred McFyord is going to attempt to swim under to the other ship withour being seen. 
  he as **2** dice in **swim** and **2** dice in **strength**.

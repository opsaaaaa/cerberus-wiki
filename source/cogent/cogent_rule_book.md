## Foreword

**An Introduction to ‘Cogent Roleplay’**

Let us introduce ourselves - we are Josiah Brooks and Shad Brooks, two nerdy

brothers who have always enjoyed role-playing and all it has to offer. We

created Cogent Roleplay to address the rampant problems in many PnP (Pen &

Paper) RPGs (Role-playing Games). We feel you will have a much more

rewarding experience with this game over others as Cogent not only resolves

issues present in other systems, but aims to provide new and innovative ways to

experience role-play.

Cogent Roleplay is easily adapted to any world setting or genre. It is simple

enough for first-timers to easily learn and play, without sacrificing the depth and

clarity needed to satisfy experienced RPG-ers. On top of this, the rules of Cogent

are extremely flexible, and are easy to expand upon and create unique and

interesting magic systems, genre/setting mechanics, and more.

It is our hope that Cogent provides you with endless hours of fun. If you have any

suggestions regarding the rules or how the Cogent Roleplaying system could be

improved, please send us your feedback via [http://www.cogentroleplay.com.](http://www.cogentroleplay.com.) We

endeavor to continue to polish and refine the Cogent system to be as enjoyable

as possible.

Thanks for checking out Cogent Roleplay, we hope you have a blast!


## Introduction

```
Welcome to Cogent Roleplay - a Tabletop Pen and Paper Role-playing game that is easy to learn, flexibiiile,
comprehensive, sophisticated and of course loads of fun. The Cogent Roleplaying System aims to provide
you with the tools you need to experience adventures as any character you can imagine, such as a great
hero, scoundrel, villain, thief, rogue or any other. Your stories will unfold in all kinds of worlds and settings,
such as classic medieval fantasy, science fiction, space opera, zombie apocalypse, steampunk, superhero
```
- or something of your own unique creation. Have fun, be fearless and create your own stories worthy of the
    greatest myths, legends and chronicles!

What is a Tabletop Pen and Paper Role-Playing Game?
```
Let's start with Role-Playing. As the term implies role-playing means to take on the role of
someone else, specifically, a character you will create and play the role of in your game. **Role
playing** is by far the most important aspect of the **Cogent Roleplay** system. Everything in this
game is made to promote better, more immersive and satisfying Role-play. That being said,
what matters most in the end is your imagination and creativity.

Any character you take the role of could be yourself in a fictional setting; an alter-ego who just
so happens to be a heroic knight, daring space captain or cunning super spy. On the other
hand, the character you roleplay could be someone completely different to you, which will
often open up roleplay experiences previously unimagined! In any case being consistent and
true to whatever character you're playing will prove most rewarding.

When ‘ **Tabletop Pen and Paper** ’ is combined with ‘ **Role-Playing** ’, immersive realism is the result.
The actions you attempt while role-playing are governed by simple rules and character statistics,
and the role of dice determines the result. This dice rolling simulates the chaotic unpredictability
and suspense of real life, as within the game there's always a chance of failure - but failure isn't a
bad thing! Often it’s the failures that unlock the most suspense in your game, and result in some
of the most hilarious stories.

The core structure of any Tabletop Pen and Paper Role-Playing game is made of two
components:
● Players who take on the role of the **player characters** (sometimes referred to as **PCs** ), and
act out the characters dreams, goals and aspirations.
● A **Narrator** (sometimes referred to as a Game Master), who acts as referee and drives the
game and story forward by controlling the world that the players are interacting with.


### How is Role-Playing Done?

Players take on the _role_ of their character, meaning that regardless of their own ambitions or
desires as a player, they _act how that character would act_.

Here is a bad example of roleplay:

```
JOHN (Character: MARCUS)
"My character says to Tim’s character that we should be careful of an ambush."
```
The problem with interactions like this is that it’s impersonal. The players need to step inside their
own character and speak as that character. Therefore, if John's character Marcus is a selfish
and impatient rogue, the role-play might proceed something like this:

#### JOHN (MARCUS)

```
"(To Tim’s character, Gareth) Hey meatbag, tread carefully! Bandits roam these parts
and
I wouldn't be surprised if some may be lying in wait to ambush us.”
```
```
John would then wait for Tim to respond, likewise, in character. For example if Tim’s character is
a hot-tempered thick-headed warrior named Gareth, the roleplay might then proceed
something like this:
```
```
TIM (GARETH)
"Such foolish bandits, why would they be lying down if their intent is to ambush
travelers? Surely it would take too much time to stand up!"
```
```
JOHN (MARCUS)
"Yeah, you should ask them that if we come across any."
```
```
TIM (GARETH)
"I will!"
```
Speaking freely as your character (warts and all) will enhance the immersion of the game and
make it a lot more fun. Not only should the player speak as their character, but they should
speak the same way their character would speak. You can even speak in an accent if you
want!

The player characters will come across many other characters controlled and played by the
Narrator. These are called ‘ **non-player characters** ’ and are often referred to as ‘ **NPCs’**.

The Narrator is the most important person in any tabletop Role-playing game as you can’t play
without one. They describe everything in the game’s world and setting to aid the players in
visualizing the adventures. They run the game through the rules the system provides, informing
the players when they are required to make dice rolls, which will then determine the success or
failure of their actions.

Ultimately, a well-crafted Pen and Paper Role-playing game provides structure and immersion to
something humans have done since caveman times; communal storytelling.


## Chapter 1 – How To Play

### Part 1 – Challenge Levels

Cogent Roleplay revolves around a simple mechanic called the **‘Challenge Level’** , or **‘CL’**.

When a player character chooses to make an action within the game, the Narrator can assign
them a **CL** based on the difficulty of what they will attempt to perform – the more difficult the
task, the higher the **CL** , ranging from 1 (a common task) to 8 (inconceivable!).

The characters’ statistics (see Character Creation’ – page 9 ) will determine the amount of dice
that can be rolled against the **CL**. Each dice represents a 50/50 chance to gain a **win** or **loss**
towards the CL.

```
On a traditional 6-sided dice (or ‘ D6 ’) any dice roll that shows a 1 - 3 is considered a loss,
While any dice that shows a 4 - 6 is a win
```
To pass the **Challenge Level** you must roll enough **wins** equivalent to, or greater than, the set **CL**.

```
For example:
Your character wants to climb a wall and the Narrator assigns this task a CL of 3.
You have five dice to roll which means at least three dice must achieve a win to
succeed against the CL.
```
```
The more dice a player has to roll against a CL, the higher the chance they will succeed.
```
```
SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH.
Challenge Level (CL) Difficulty Scale
```

Challenge levels are assigned to any task that has a reasonable chance of failure. The more
difficult the task, the higher the **CL**. These **CL** ratings are classified as follows:

Common Task CL 1
Uncommon Task CL 2
Specialized Task CL 3
Difficult CL 4
Extremely difficult CL 5
Unrealistic CL 6
Virtually Impossible CL 7
Inconceivable CL 8

For every action the players wish to perform, it’s the Narrator’s job to assess each request and
judge how difficult such a task would be. Using these classifications, they then assign the CL.
Below are some examples of CL’s a Narrator might choose to assign to various tasks. Each
Narrator is entitled to make their own judgements on how difficult a task is, and CL’s will often
vary between Narrators, campaigns, task circumstances and game sessions.

#### EXAMPLE ACTION EXAMPLE CL

```
Climb a rope 20 meters in the rain 4
Do a triple back-flip 5
Ride a horse without a saddle 3
Override the console of a basic space craft 4
Catch a flying arrow 6
Lift a car 7
```
A narrator may be tempted to assign a higher or lower CL to a more capable character
because such tasks would be easier to them based on their skills. **DO NOT DO THIS**. CL’s should
be always be assigned based on how difficult the task would be _to a regular person in that
setting_. It is a character's skills (or lack thereof) that will affect their potential to succeed in an
action – not an altered CL.

Every character begins with a base of three dice (or **3 D6** ), called the ‘base roll’. The player then
adds additional dice to their base roll for every point their character has in any **attribute** and **skill**
that is applicable to the task.

Example: _A character attempts to pick a lock – the Narrator assigns a_ **_CL_** _of 3 (a
specialized task)._

_1. The player begins with their base roll (_ **_3D6_** _).
2. The player has two points in the skill ‘infiltration’, which can be applied logically to_
    _complete the task (_ **_+2 D6_** _)._
3. _The player has 1 point in the attribute ‘intelligence’, which is the core attribute of_
    _‘infiltration’, and will receive an additional die for this (_ **_+1 D6_** _)._
4. _The player rolls the total of_ **_6 D6_** _against the_ **_CL_**_._

As previously mentioned, the players’ roll is successful if the number of **wins** is equivalent to or
greater than the **CL** assigned to the task.


### Part 2 – Actions and Conflicts

**Challenge Levels** come in two forms; **Actions** or **Conflicts**.

```
An Action is any task a player makes against something that cannot intentionally resist
```
```
A Conflict occurs when the player makes an action against something that can resist
```
**Actions: Success and Failure**

Something that is absolutely crucial in Cogent Roleplay is how success and failure can be
treated. For example, most often people think of failure as **Literal Failure** of the task - Failing to
pick a lock means... well, you failed to pick a lock. Dice rolls are most often interpreted this way,
and is standard practice in many PnP RPGs.

In addition to Literal Failure, Cogent Roleplay encourages the use of something called **Narrative
Failure**. Narrative Failure doesn’t mean that the _action itself_ failed, rather the _desired outcome_.

```
For Example:
If a player is trying to sneak into a walled city and fails the assigned CL , a Narrative Failure
might mean that they still climbed the wall (as intended), but are greeted by a
guardsman at the top of the wall (... clearly not the desired outcome!). It might also
mean when they crest the wall they knock off a loose stone which crashes to the ground
below, making a VERY loud noise.
```
```
If the player’s roll produces only losses and no wins , this can be considered a critical fail.
The narrator might have the wall fall over while the character is clinging to it, crushing the
king who just so happened to be walking by on the other side in front of countless
witnesses.
```
**Narrative Failure** may provide interesting avenues of storytelling, and add loads of fun. Of course
sometimes **Narrative Failure** just doesn’t fit or a **Literal Failure** makes more sense. It’s the
Narrator’s job to decide when to use either method.


**Reflexive Actions**

Situations may arise in which a player must respond reflexively to a threat, which may have the
potential to harm or injure them. In these situations the Narrator will tell the player to respond in a
specific way, which will vary based on the threat.

Threatening challenges like this will ascribe injury to a character based on the amount of failed
dice required to succeed the CL (within context of the level of danger the task entails).

For Example:

```
Response to Threats: Roll: Result:
An ‘acrobatics’ check while
falling from a dangerous height
```
```
CL of 4, the character
rolls with 6 dice receiving
three wins
```
```
The character missed the CL by
1 and receives a level 1 injury
(see injury under combat)
```
```
A ‘survival’ roll to find food in the
wilderness
```
```
CL of 3, the character
rolls with 7 dice receiving
4 wins
```
```
The character successfully finds
food
```
```
A ‘strength’ check to resist the
effects of an ingested poison
```
```
CL of 6, the Character
rolls with 7 dice and
receives only 3 wins
```
```
The character missed the CL by
3 and receives a level three
injury, meaning they will die
unless treated in the near future
```
(For more on Levels of Injury, see page 31)

**Conflicts**

A **conflict** occurs when an action is taken against another character that can actively oppose it.
Conflicts may arise in various forms, such as combat, arm wrestling, seduction, or sneaking up on
someone. Both parties involved will be required to make a roll, applying the appropriate
attribute and/or skill points (determined by the situation).

Within conflicts where all characters are considered aware and **active** , rolls that are tied/equal
are simply re-rolled. If one of the characters within the conflict is using the perception skill (most
often due to being unaware of the opponent’s actions), they are considered **passive** and will
win in the case of a tie.

Examples of conflicts that involve multiple **active** opponents:
_Arm wrestle, combat, foot race, battle of wits, bartering with a shopkeeper etc._
Examples of conflicts that involve a **passive** opponent:
_Lying to someone, sneaking up on someone, seducing, pick-pocketing etc._

Most Conflicts are simple and require each character to make one roll. When conflicts take
several rolls to resolve (such as in combat) the conflict is conducted in a Round by Round format
(see Combat, page 30 ).

## Chapter 2 – Character Creation

## Part 1 – Identity

Tabletop Role-playing really begins for the players with Character creation. Here you must think
of a character you wish to play. This could be an alternate version of yourself or someone
completely different. The possibilities are endless and you’ll always be able to find a character
you want to play

A real and well-rounded character can’t just be summarized into a morality archetype. A real
person generally does both good things and bad things, motivated by core characteristics. This
doesn’t mean that your character can’t be wholly good or wholly evil, just that a character’s
actions shouldn’t be structured by the player character or Narrator around a pre-set archetype,
as this will most likely produce a boring character. A wholly good character is still capable of
bad things if they have a powerful enough reason or motivation to do so.

They key is being consistent to who your character is and you determine who they are at the
very beginning.

```
A few words on: Playing as a Group
```
```
Something that’s quite important to keep in mind before you dive into making your
character is the ‘party’, the other character’s your fellow players will be controlling.
```
```
The Party needs to have a reason to at least stick together. They don’t necessarily have
to get along; though it helps the party achieve their goals, getting along in-game isn’t
necessarily more or less fun. A character that doesn’t mesh well with the other
characters can actually add a lot of fun and realism in roleplay, though it needs to be
handled with maturity so players don’t take offence to things the character does in
game when the player is simply being true to their character. It’s only difficult to play a
character that doesn’t get along with other characters when they don’t get along so
much that it’s unrealistic for the characters to stay together.
```
```
As mentioned before the party needs at least a reason to stay together otherwise it
defeats the purpose of the game. You can’t play as a group if one of the characters
leaves the party for in-game reasons. Still if a player does this out of being true to their
character, there is nothing stopping them from making a new character that can join
the party soon after.
```

Remember that in settings with action, swords, magic, guns or lasers, Characters die. Cogent
Roleplay is a game with rules - rules that are there to provide an appropriate level of challenge.
Sometimes failure will simply lead to your character’s death. This can (belive it or not) be **fun**.
Your character may even opt to go out in a blaze of glory. Of course sometime it’s not
particularly fun, but if the dice decide it’s your characters time to die then there’s not much that
can be done about it! We suggest you always have a second character concept ready to
make a new character in case your current character dies.

When making a character, try to match the seriousness and realism of them to the setting and
genre you’re playing in. Make them real, give them goals and a history. Indeed on the Cogent
Roleplay Character Sheet there are several Core Characteristic requirements to be filled out:

**Character disposition**
Are they happy, sad, moody, funny, cautious, untrusting, stupid, smart, tactical, shy or
boisterous? The list can go on and on. This doesn’t mean that they can’t be in any other
mood, just that generally a person’s standard disposition is quite consistent throughout
their lives. It is often wise to base these dispositions on a character's history and
beliefs/morality, to build a character with depth and motive.

```
Character History
A good history can help shape who your character is in great ways. You don’t have to
write a novel but generally the more detailed the better - of course there isn’t a lot of
room on the character sheet for a detailed character history, but you may choose the
write one elsewhere. A good history can make your character feel much more real
which will then in turn help your role-play be more convincing, rewarding and fun.
```
**Beliefs / Morality**
It’s hard to find a person without a specific world view, with defined things that they see
as good or evil. So a realistic character should also have these things. Even having no
morals or belief is a morality and a belief. No matter what you chose for your character
you should always answer why your characters believes the things they do and **why** they
see things as evil and things as good. This will define your character even more

**Goals / Aspirations**
Everybody has goal or aspirations. They’re one way people give purpose to their lives, so
what purpose does your character see for themselves? This specific characteristic will
very much guide what you character will do in game. It’s recommended that you
choose several long-term and short-term goals and aspirations.

Following these suggestions will guide you to make a very well defined character. The next step
is to define them through their statistics.


## Attributes Part 2 – Character Statistics

Characters statistics in Cogent Roleplay can be broken down into two categories which
determine the bonuses (or penalties) you receive when rolling against **Challenge Levels**
encountered in the game, whether **Tasks** or **Conflicts**. These categories are:

## Attributes

## &

## Skills (Overview).............................................................................................................................

By default, player characters will be given **2 Attribute points** and **8 skill points** they may assign to
their character during character creation.

### Attributes

Attributes represent the physical abilities of your character. There are three:

### Strength

### Reflex

### Intelligence

On the character sheet they look like this:

```
When assigning a point to an attribute or skill,
simply ‘shade’ a box in with your pencil as shown above.
```
These three attributes cover all of the actions your player might attempt. Upon first glance it can
seem like many physical abilities or qualities a person can possess are missed (most other
roleplay systems have a lot more), such as stamina, constitution, speed, knowledge, charisma
etc. but in Cogent, these things are incorporated into the three Attributes above. Things like
constitution and stamina are covered in strength, speed in reflex, and knowledge and charisma
in intelligence. There’s no need to overcomplicate it!


Each of these attributes apply to certain skill checks and to all combat rolls. From a combat
perspective, one point in Intelligence and one point in Reflex have the same dice bonus as two
points in strength. This is because a fast or clever opponent may very well be just as challenging
as a strong one.

In addition to granting bonus dice to appropriate rolls, each attribute also gives a specific
advantage unrelated to dice checks. These are:

### Strength

```
For every point in strength the character can reduce a victory level achieved
against them in combat once every combat encounter
```
### Reflex

```
As combat is conducted in a round by round format, the player with the
highest reflex gets priority in that round.
```
### Intelligence

```
For every point in intelligence the player receives
two 3 additional skill points to spend.
```
_Think of it like this:_

An average person in any setting will have the equivalent of **0** points in each. **1** point in any of
these attributes equates to the character being professional or naturally gifted in that area.
**2** points in any one attribute would equate to being elite or ‘world-class’ in that aspect.

_For Example:_
**0 Points 1 Point 2 Points
STRENTH** Average Professional wrestler or
weight lifter

```
Olympic level weightlifter or
world champion fighter
REFLEX Average Race car driver or
gifted acrobat
```
```
Gold-medalist gymnast or
master martial artist
INTELLIGENCE Average High school science
teacher or a con artist
```
```
Award-winning particle
physicist or ‘Sherlock Holmes’
level detective
```
Some settings (depending on the narrator) may allow for over 2 points in one attribute. These are
mostly justifiable through means of superhuman powers, genetic anomaly, magical
enchantment or advanced technology.


### Skills - Overview

During character creation, each character receives **8 points** to spend on any combination of
skills. Players may gain additional points to spend in this phase by either accepting a Disabling
Characteristic (See: Disabling Characteristics, Page 16 ) or by assigning attribute points to
Intelligence (+3 skill points per point in Intelligence). Each point represents an additional dice the
character receives when making dice checks using the applicable skill.

```
Just like with Attributes, when assigning a point simply ‘shade’ a box in with your pencil as shown above.
The tapered box on the far left is there to ‘cross out’ if you take a negative in a skill.
```
```
Although this tapered ‘negative’ box is also present in the Attributes section, players may not choose to have a negative
in an attribute – it is only there in case a disabling characteristic demands a negative be applied to an attribute.
```
Every **skill** has an attribute (or attributes) it is based on. For example, the skill ‘ **Persuade** ’ is based
on the Attribute ‘ **Intelligence’**. When rolling a skill check, players must add both the skill points
applicable (1D6 per skill point), as well as a dice for each point in the Attribute it is based on.

For Example, your character has **1** point in **Strength** and **3** points in **Athletics**. When they perform
an athletics check they will begin with their base of **3 D6** , add **1 D6** for their **STR** Attribute, and **3D**
for their **Athletics** skill. The result is **7D6** to roll with:


Skills checks may be attempted even if your character has no points spent on that specific skill.
In this case players add the normal bonus from an associated attribute being **Strength** , **Reflex** , or
**Intelligence** (if any) to their base **3D6** when making any dice check.

There are some actions that are solely Attribute based, such as lifting something heavy (strength)
or making a mathematical calculation (Intelligence). These checks are referred to as either a
**Strength Check** , **Reflex Check** , or **Intelligence Check**.

Skills are divided down into three categories, each of which have different base Attributes or
applications. These categories are:

```
Core Skills
Perception, or Strength/Reflex/Intelligence Based Skills.
Max 4 points per core skill. Players may take 1 ‘negative’
and apply the point to any other skill
```
```
Vocations
Skills which define a character’s class, and applies to assists (see: Assists, page 28 )
Max 4 points per vocation. Players may not take ‘negatives’
```
```
Proficiencies
Applicable to combat rolls and can be used to assist
(see: Combat, page 30 , see: Assists, page 28 )
Max 2 points per proficiency. Players may not take ‘negatives’
```
Each skill point represents an additional dice the player may to role with when making
corresponding **CL** dice checks.


### Skills - Breakdown

**Core Skills**
For detailed descriptions of core skills see: part 3 - skills in detail, page 19

```
Perception:
Unlike the other core skills, Perception rolls receive a bonus D6 for EVERY attribute point.
```
```
Whenever anything happens around the players they should get a chance to notice it, this is
what the perception skill is used for. Searching, noticing things out of the corner of your eye, this
all comes under perception. It is also used to counter stealth, persuasion and deception rolls
made against the player.
```
```
Strength Based Skills:
Each of these skills, when applied to rolls, receive a bonus D6 per STR.
```
```
Athletics
Grapple
Swim
Aim/Throw
```
```
Reflex Based Skills:
Each of these skills, when applied to rolls, receive a bonus D6 per REF.
```
```
Acrobatics
Ride/pilot
Sleight of hand
Stealth
```
```
Intelligence Based Skills:
Each of these skills, when applied to rolls, receive a bonus D6 per INT.
```
```
Deception
Persuasion
Infiltration
Survival
```
**Vocations**
Vocation skills can only be used to assist other skill checks (see assists page 28 ). Essentially
vocations can be seen as the character class component of Cogent Roleplay. A vocation can
be many things like the classic fantasy character classes such as knight, druid, wizard, ninja,
soldier or more mundane vocations like blacksmith or baker

**Proficiencies**
Proficiencies encompasses combat focused skills. The core skills cannot be used to attack
(though they can be used to assist attacks). Each point spent on a proficiency grants **+1d6** ,
added to the character’s combat roll.


## Disabling Characteristics

Playing as an ‘unstoppable fighter’ can be less satisfying than playing an average fighter who
struggles to beat a strong challenge. The greater the challenge a player overcomes, the more
satisfaction the achievement. This concept also applies with characteristics. Often, disabling
characteristics can create a richer and more entertaining character.

Taking on such a disabling characteristic does restrict the way in how you’ll play your character
in game, that’s why they are called **disabling** characteristics. It will make your role-play more
challenging and thereby more satisfying. However, because such characteristics are restrictive,
it’s only fair that the player who chooses to have one for their character receives an equivalent
bonus. This bonus is also in place to encourage players to take on such characteristic who
wouldn’t do so normally.

```
If you choose a Disabling Characteristic from the table below, or create one that
the Narrator approves, you will receive one additional Skill point to spend in
character creation.
```
```
Alternatively you may roll a twenty sided dice, the resulting number
corresponding to the table below, and take the Disabling Characteristic
associated. This cannot be taken back. If you choose to roll for a Disabling
Characteristic you must keep it! It will forever be a part of that character. In doing
this you will receive two additional skill points to spend.
```
A player may apply (or roll for) as many disabling characteristics as they want, unless the
Narrator stops them past a certain point.

You don’t need to take a characteristic listed on the table provided, you’re free to make up
whatever disabling characteristic you can think of, and your Narrator will decide if the
characteristic you have chosen is disabling enough to receive the standard bonus given in the
rules.

Disabling Characteristics should always be chosen or rolled before any points are assigned to
Skills, otherwise often you may find that a disabling characteristic might utterly disqualify a skill
you have chosen. For example, it’s obviously hard to use the skill deception if you have the
Disabling Characteristic, ‘Can’t Lie’.

Narrators should also be aware that it is possible for the player characters to overcome many
disabling through the narrative of the story. A character whose life was saved by a race which
they have an extreme prejudice against might rightly have their prejudice soften or even go
away.

```
SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH.
Disabling Characteristics
```

```
Following is a list of 20 disabling characteristics a player may roll for, including detail:
```
*Narrator must define specifics
provide definitions and examples and penalties

```
● 1. Missing a bodily extremity/limb
The obvious example is that the character could have lost their hand or foot, but this
may also include another extremity such as a nose or, you know... penis.
● 2. Feeble (- 1 to all Strength* based skills and Strength Checks)
This may mean the character is malnourished, genetically weak, or may be the result of
an injury. The character is far weaker than a normal person.
● 3. Heavy (- 1 to all Reflex* based skills and Reflex Checks)
The character may be big boned, have lots of muscle, or be excessively overweight.
● 4. Dim-witted (- 1 to all Intelligence* based skills and Intelligence Checks)
A result from a bad head injury, or the character may simply be stupid.
● 5. Phobia
This is a debilitating fear that the character possesses that is to be selected by the
narrator and can range from heights, to spiders or little children
● 6. Extreme prejudice
Race, culture, sexual orientation, political affiliation or religion. The Narrator is free to be
creative, for example, making the character want to kill every person that supports a
specific sports team, or hold irrational hatred to those who wear anything with ribbons.
● 7. Compulsive liar
This characteristic needs to be played in the right way - the player shouldn’t lie about
everything to the point that it’s impossible to hold a conversation with them. Generally it
would be about anything concerning their achievements or anything that would give
them an advantage no matter how small, like claiming the gold coin a character found
on the ground, or inventing feats of heroism while constantly trying to seduce people.
● 8. Kleptomaniac
Kleptomania is not necessarily the desire to steal but rather a compulsive need to have
most things they see for reasons other than personal use or financial gain. Many of the
items a kleptomaniac steals are useless to them and the item’s value does not weigh in
on their compulsion at all, thus most items a kleptomaniac steals are worth very little.
● 9. Paranoia
The extreme belief that every person they meet will eventually betray them, that the
government is run by an evil cult or that if they ever urinate on the grass they will
become infected with a terminal disease.
● 10. Over-emotional (specific emotion)
Cannot control their anger, every time they see an old person they burst out into
hysterics, whenever they become fearful they utterly freeze up and cannot move or the
character breaks down and cries whenever anyone says the slightest thing negative
about them.
● 11. Very Forgetful
This does not mean forgetting everything to the point that the character is an
unintelligible drooling oaf. This characteristic can manifest in such ways as a character
always forgetting where they are and getting lost all the time, forgetting plans, directions
or instructions. They might never be able to remember the names of people, towns or
countries, or they may constantly forget where they put their items.
● 12. Paraphilia
A paraphilia is characterized by an abnormal sexual attraction, typically involving
extreme or dangerous activities, such as being sexually attracted to fire, or lamps.
```

● **13. Overconfident** (cannot spend points on an applicable skill during character creation)
You are extremely overconfident in a specific skill, such as stealth, and will feel that you'll
always succeed in any activity using it. You will readily resort to any method that can
employ the said skill and volunteer to use it whenever the opportunity arises.
● **14. Incapable of Lying** (specific parameters required)
This is not a blanket restriction, the character will be able to lie, but not in circumstances
the narrator specifies - such as not being able to lie to a certain gender. It might also
mean a character can't speak any ‘untruths’ but are still able to mislead people (like the
Aes Sedai in ‘the Wheel of Time’ novels). It may also mean the character has a very
prominent physical tell whenever they lie such as sneezing or farting.
● **15. Addiction**
This is not simply a preference of a certain thing, it is a disabling addiction, something
that the character has withdrawals from if the addiction isn't satisfied often. The
addiction itself can include things like sex, drugs, specific foods, or even murder.
● **16. Delusion**
Examples: having an imaginary friend, hearing voices, or honestly believing that pot
plants are secretly an invading alien race.
● **17. Imperceptive** (Cannot apply standard base 3D6 to environmental perception* rolls)
● **18. Gullible** (Cannot apply standard base 3D6 to perception* rolls VS. deception)
● **19. Impressionable** (Cannot apply standard base 3D6 to perception* rolls VS. persuasion)
● **20. People Pleaser** (Overly agreeable, ‘yes man’)

## Part 3 – Skills in Detail

### CORE SKILLS

These are the primary common skills generally used by most people. These skills can have a max
of four points spent on each of them, and a player may also take a single ‘negative’ point from
one of these skills, and apply the removed point elsewhere.

Core Skills cannot be added into combat rolls. The only way Core skills can aid combat rolls is
through assists (see Assists, page 28 ).

**PERCEPTION**

Perceptions stands apart from other Core Skills, as it is one of the most widely used skills. It is used
as the defense against deception, persuasion _and_ stealth, and it will be common for the
Narrator to require players make environmental ‘Perception Checks’ to gauge how much the
characters notice regarding current happenings or places, whether obvious or subtle.

Every character is going to rely on perception in one way or another and though players can
spend skill points on perception like any other skill (max being 4), perception rolls gain an
additional **+1D6** for **any attribute points** , where the other core skills each have a base attribute
they are tied to (STR, REF or INT).

**STRENGTH BASED SKILLS**

 **Athletics**
The Athletics skill is to be used for endurance dice checks, running speed dice checks and other
logically applicable things like jumping
 **Grapple**
Grapple encompasses hand strength and your ability to hold on to things, like dangling from a
rope or climbing a wall. Sometimes the definition of the word Grapple can be used to refer to
wrestling and martial arts, according to Cogent this definition does not apply. The grapple skill,
like all skills, cannot be used in combat rolls, though it can be used to assist. Grappling in the
sense of wrestling, judo, submission holds use a different skill set to the grapple skill and can be
selected as a proficiency.
 **Swim**
Applicable to feats whereupon a character desires to not sink in liquid. This may be more difficult
if a character is wearing heavy clothing or resisting conflicts at the same time.
 **Aim/Throw**
The core throwing ability is different to throwing a weapon. This skill is used to throw an object to
another character in the game, throw a grappling hook over a wall successfully or drop an
object onto someone else’s head. Of course the Aim/Throw skill can be used to assist thrown
based weapons and likewise, thrown based combat rolls can be used to assist Aim/Throw
checks.


**REFLEX BASED SKILLS**

 **Acrobatics**
Dodging, performing aerobatic feats such as flips and handsprings
 **Ride/pilot**
Riding a horse, driving a car/cart, piloting a spaceship. When the ride skill is chosen the player
must choose what type of animal or craft it applies to
 **Sleight of hand**
Picking pockets, or doing anything with your hands that you want to remain unnoticed, or which
takes more ‘hand skill’ then normal tasks.
 **Stealth**
Sneaking, hiding from others and moving with no noise

**INTELLIGENCE BASED SKILLS**

 **Deception**
Deception can be used for disguise checks and anything that is meant to mislead others. An
important thing to note regarding deception, is that the knowledge of the person you are trying
to deceive/persuade should affect the CL of the roll. For instance trying to tell someone that
you’re the queen of England, even though you’re a man, to a person who has seen the queen is
mostly impossible no matter how convincing you are. In these situations, while the character
may attempt such a lie, the Narrator may also apply a severe ‘negative’ to the Skill Roll, such as

- 4D6. The player may then proceed to roll against the opponents perception skill will the
negative applied.
     **Persuasion**
This skill can be used in very similar ways to deception. It can even assist a deception check as a
deception check can assist persuasion in most circumstances. If a player attempts to persuade
a PC or NPC to do something they would naturally be opposed to, the Narrator may assign
negatives to the players dice roll.
     **Infiltration**
Picking locks, hacking a computer, opening a safe, knowing likely security measures of a
guarded castle or bank.
     **Survival**
Hunting, finding food when you need it, tending to injuries.

**VOCATIONS**

The Vocation skill category is unique among the skills. It cannot be used to make Skill Checks,
unless it’s directly associated with the skill and is not covered by another skill, such as the baking
vocation to cook bread. A Vocation is essentially an ‘assist’ skill, meaning in most situations, it
can only be used to make assist rolls to other skill checks or combat rolls, and only if the vocation
has logical and obvious association with the skill or combat roll you are trying to assist (and is
approved by the Narrator).

For example, you could pick the vocation ‘ninja’, and use this vocation skill to assist sword
combat, or stealth, but you CANNOT use ‘vocation, ninja’ to make stealth checks. Vocations do
not supersede other skills. Vocation skill points cannot be added into any dice check except
when attempting an assist.


```
Examples of vocations:
Blacksmith
Computer Expert
Carpenter
Baker
Artist
Ninja
Soldier
Specific combat discipline (A specific martial art)
Ranger
Thief
Barbarian
Samurai
```
The player has the freedom to pick almost any vocation, but can’t pick all-encompassing meta-
game vocations like, ‘God’, or ‘master of everything’. It has to be a logical and pre-established
Vocation fitting within the game world the Narrator has prepared.

Though the player has freedom to choose their Vocation, their choice must be approved by the
Narrator, who may also clarify how the chosen Vocation works in the Narrator’s setting – for
example, a ranger is quite different in modern military compared to fantasy, and in different
fantasies there may be differences in seemingly traditional Classes/Vocations.

A character can have more than one Vocation and can spend a maximum of four points in
each Vocation. A player may not assign Vocation ‘negatives’ unless the Narrator says otherwise.

**PROFICIENCIES - COMBAT**

The proficiency skill category encompasses combat applicable skills. The core skills cannot be
used to attack (though they can be used to assist attacks). Each point spent on a proficiency
grants **+1d6** , which is added to the character’s combat roll.

Proficiencies are more specialized and rare than Core Skills. Because of this, and to keep
combat balanced, **Each proficiency can have a maximum of 2 points** (this is in contrast to
general skills and vocations which each can have maximum 4).

Proficiencies accommodate things like supernatural abilities (magic or superpowers). If there is to
be magic within a campaign setting, a player may need to specify a sub-type of magic as a
Proficiency Skill by spending points on it to be able to use it in game (see example magic
system, page 52 ).

Proficiencies are added to the base **3D6** in combat rolls. In non-combat CL Tasks (such as Skill
Checks) a character’s proficiency may be used in an ‘assist’ roll if it can logically be justified.

A character can have more than one Proficiency, and cannot have Proficiency ‘negatives’.


**PROFICIENCIES - WEAPON**

Players may assign their character a ‘Weapon Proficiency’, such as ‘Weapon Proficiency,
Longbow’. Weapon proficiencies may vary depending on the setting. Please remember that the
Narrator has freedom to define how any proficiency works within their setting.

Weapons are divided into sizes and categories. These are further explained in the chapter,
‘Combat’ (see Combat, page 30). Shown below are the various Weapon Proficiency categories
accompanied by examples of applicable weapons from various world settings:

```
Thrown weapon
Throwing dagger, shuriken
```
```
Flex ranged
Bows, crossbows
```
**Small handed weapons**
Dagger, shorsword.

**Small hafted weapons**
Small axe, crowbar, pick, kama

```
Medium long hafted
These are one handed weapons that carry a top heavy implement on the end of a haft or
shaft such as a one handed, axe, mace or warhammer
```
```
Large long hafted
These are two handed weapons that carry a top heavy implement on the end of a haft or
shaft such as a two handed, axe, mace or warhammer
```
```
Medium swords
These are the one handed swords such as Arming-sword, sidesword, broadsword, one-
handed falchion, messer, one-handed scimitar or wakizashi
```
```
Large swords
These are the two-handed sword such as Longsword, katana, two-handed falchion, two
handed scimitar or kriegsmesser
```
```
Reach Polearms
These are long two handed weapons with reach such as the spear, halberd, poleax or
greatsword (historically a Greatsword is more like a polearm than a sword)
```
```
Hand ballistic
Handgun or Uzi
```
```
Shoulder stocked ballistic
Rifle or Shotgun
```
**Heavy ballistic**
Bazooka, heavy machine gun or minigun

```
Unarmed
Unarmed martial arts or fist like weapons such as brass knuckles and punch daggers.
```
(Please note that the weapons that are given as examples in each proficiency category are
simply examples. Players or Narrators may very well invent variations of these weapon types.)


**PROFICIENCIES - METAHUMAN (MAGIC AND SUPERPOWERS)**

The proficiency skill category is also to be used for supernatural, or metahuman abilities if the
setting you’re playing in has any. (For the sake of simplicity, from this point onward any type of
magic, superpower or sci-fi enhancement will simply be referred to as ‘magic’, and when
referred to, it applies also to all supernatural abilities that could be added into any setting).

The Narrator will assign a proficiency skill for each specific magic type that exists in the setting.

The following must be considered when a Narrator decides how the magic works in the setting:

```
● Can anyone attempt to perform a spell even without the specific proficiency skill in
the same way anyone can pick up a sword and try to use it? Remember that in both
cases with the sword and magic, having no proficiency with them would result in
many failed rolls. Can only people with at least 1 proficiency point in the magic use
it?
● Do you want magic to be more powerful than normal weapon skills, or have it
balanced? *
● How encompassing do you want the magic to be? Is there a single magic
proficiency or is it broken down into categories such as earth, air, fire and water, or
Sorcery, Wizardry, Witchcraft, druidism, Necromancy and Holy?
● Is there a limit to the magic’s use? Can a player only cast a certain amount of spells
a day or per combat encounter?
```
```
* A few words on Magic and Weapons:
```
```
As will be explained in the combat chapter every weapon receives a weapon bonus depending
on its type. This bonus stays when making any roll that uses the weapon proficiency and generally
results in more dice to roll with when using proficiencies than with skills. It’s up to the narrator if they
wish to add weapon type bonuses to magic proficiencies.
```
```
For instance, using a wand might grant a +1 dice while using a staff might grant a +2. Alternatively
if the narrator does not wish to add weapon bonuses to magic proficiencies they might decide
that the magic simply cannot be used without a wand or staff.
```
```
If weapon bonuses are added to magic proficiencies, the magic will then have the same amount
of dice as other combat/weapon proficiencies - this might seem balanced but it may not be - It
can potentially make magic more powerful than common combat/weapon proficiencies
depending on setting. A player can do far more with telekinetic powers than with a sword.
```
```
Magic generally comes off to be far more versatile and usable in more situations than the basic
combat/weapon proficiencies. Taking away the weapon bonuses for magic balances this as
magic based proficiencies will generally have less total dice as a result, making them less effective
in combat, but they will be as versatile as they were. So the trade in balance is versatility vs a
higher chance of success, and being stronger in combat.
```
In the chapter: supplementary Content, we have provided an example magic system that can
be used or adapted into various settings - or used as a model on which you may craft your own
(see Example Magic System, page 52 ).


## Part 4 – Destiny Points

In Cogent we want you to create a character that feels real, has motives, desires, goals, flaws
quirks and opinions. We feel that the more in depth your character is, the more you will be
drawn into the game you are playing. As a type of reward system to encourage this, Cogent
Roleplay implements what we call **Destiny points**.

A Destiny Point is an infinitely useful and valuable thing to players. A Destiny point can be spent
to add an additional win to any dice roll you make in the game, thereby tipping the balance in
your favor. More than one destiny point can be spent at a time to add more than one win to a
dice roll.

Every character starts a campaign with **three** destiny points (unless the Narrator says otherwise).

Destiny points are throughout gameplay to players when they do something significantly in
character, true to who their character is, and likewise destiny points are to be deducted when a
player does something very contrary to the character they are supposed to be playing, as
outlined in their character description. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember to a lot these
points regularly, therefore we recommend using landmark moments such as the end of a
difficult quest or regrouping after a lengthy assault, to assign destiny points to players based on
their efforts for playing their characters pro-actively and with integrity.


## Part 5 – Commerce Points

The commerce point system is optional and the Narrator can choose to use it or resort to a
traditional numeric method (Keeping track of the number of dollars or gold coins a player has
earned or spent). The Commerce point system provides an easier way to govern the commerce
of your games without the need to constantly calculate purchases and total currency amounts.

Below is an item value system that ranges from 1 to 8 that is to be used by the narrator to help
calculate the value of any given item in the game.

**Item Value** _(these values are suggestions, as narrative settings and their values will vary)_

1 – A meal, simple pants, bottle of rum, night at an inn, a video game, rope/camping gear
2 – An extravagant night out, an adequate weapon, common livestock, shack
3 – A well-crafted weapon, a basic horse/car/vehicle, average armor, a small building
4 – A very fancy horse/vehicle, home, extravagant weapon, full plate armor, bodyguards
5 – A mansion, yacht, jet, estate, small army, established business, patent of nobility, small
starship, weapon of mass destruction
6 – A castle/skyscraper, enterprise level company, large army, a town, carrier starship
7 – Metropolis, armada, small country
8 – Kingdom, nation, established planet (sci-fi)

At the beginning of the game the narrator will assign the players a number of commerce points
based on their background (a beggar who grew up on the streets would have a lot less money
than a knight from a noble family) and then throughout the game the players may receive
additional points when they do an action that would gain them more money, or lose commerce
points when making purchases.

Commerce points and associated **Levels of Affluence**

1 – Pauper/Homeless
2 – Commoner
3 – Tradesperson/craftsman
4 – Well off, higher income
5 – Wealthy, successful merchant
6 – Rich, CEO
7 – Magnate/Tycoon, Captain of Industry
8 (max) – Owns a powerful nation

Players can purchase any item that has a value score equivalent to, or less than, their total
commerce points. Purchasing an item/service with **value equivalent** to your current level of
commerce points will **subtract/cost 2 commerce points** from your total pool.

Purchasing an item/service with value equivalent to **1 point less than** your current level of
commerce points will **subtract/cost 1 commerce point** from your total pool.

Purchasing an item/service with value equivalent to **2 points under** or **less** than your current level
of commerce points will **not remove any** points from your total pool – unless purchased in large
quantities or regularly.


```
One way to think about it might be like this:
```
```
Purchasing an item with a value equal to my level of affluence, will cost a great deal of my total
finances (Such as someone with a high income [4 commerce points] buying a nice home [lvl 4
purchase, costing two commerce points], reducing their financial status to ‘common’ [level 2]
after the purchase is made).
```
This ratio of cost for the specified item values is present because commerce points go up
exponentially in value. If item values need to be compared to one another, for a general guide
their values can be thought of as 1 of 10 going up, or 10 of 1 going down. EG: 10 cars (each with
an item value of ‘4’) might equate to the value of a single house (item value 5). This is an
example, but we recommend players use this mechanic as a guide rather than a means of
precise valuation.

This means that the third commerce point is essentially worth ten level two commerce points and
the fifth commerce point is worth one hundred level three. The narrator needs to take this into
account when awarding commerce points as going from **2** to **3** commerce points is infinitely
more easy then going from **5** to **6**.

Players will gain commerce points throughout gameplay which will be assigned by the narrator
as reward for quests (as the narrative dictates) either through the flow of narrative (finding
treasure) or roleplay (selling loot to shopkeepers).

```
SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH.4
Commerce Scale
```
#### SUGGESTION FOR SELLING/BARTERING

The item value when reselling to a vendor should may considered one point below its
suggested/original level of affluence value.

To help make the experience of buying/selling dynamic for players, a narrator might consider
allowing the cost of a desired item to ‘drop’ by one level of value, if they succeed a
‘persuasion’ or ‘deception’ check vs. a vendor. Likewise, the item may also become more
difficult to obtain if such a dice check is failed.

A narrator may also decide to allow the players to use their destiny points in making purchases
more attainable, if this can be justified through narrative in a satisfying way. That being said,
keep in mind that destiny points scale at a level of **1:1** , while commerce points scale at a ratio
closer to **1:10** , therefore a narrator may decide it may cost a **single destiny point** for a **level 3**
item to be lowered to a cost of **2** commerce points to a player, but it might cost **2 - 3 destiny
points** to bring down the cost of an item valued at **level 5- 6**.


## Chapter 3 – Gameplay Fundamentals

## Part 1 – Roleplay

**Player/Narrator Negotiation**
Cogent is a flexible system with purposeful provision for interpretation and adaptability. We’re
not going to spell every single thing out for you (like specifying each and every circumstance
where a specific skill can be used to assists another skill, or spelling out every possible vocation
you’re allowed to pick). If we did this we feel it would make the game system restrictive and
complex, which would result in a worse game by the end.

You’re smart and we trust you to see ways in which certain aspects of Cogent can benefit your
character, in things such as skill interaction, assists and combat modifiers.

However, because every person is an individual, they’ll very likely see different ways certain
things in the game can be interpreted and thereby how they feel it should affect the gameplay.
This is _wonderful_ and we encourage every player and narrator to do explore their creative ideas
as it enriches and enhances the gaming experience.

In these situation it becomes important to familiarize yourself with the process of friendly
player/narrator negotiation. If you as a player honestly feel that your character should receive a
bonus, such as an additional dice to roll with, because of some kinds of in-game circumstance,
you should feel free to suggest this to the narrator. Narrators shouldn’t feel defensive if a player
makes such suggestions - this is a great thing and shows how engaged your players are in your
game. Try to give fare consideration to every suggestion or request a player puts forward. We’re
not saying you have to agree to everything, only to give honest consideration to such
suggestions, and explain why you disagree if you do.

Players, if the narrator disagrees with you, once you have presented your argument, it is then
your responsibility to accept the Narrators decision and **don’t argue further!** That’s when the
roleplay experience gets much more frustrating, so if you feel the Narrator is giving you ‘lemons’,
just try and make ‘lemonade’.

**The Narrator shouldn’t hold your hand, be creative to survive**
Even in the most hopeless situations, clever thinking can achieve a great deal. Don’t just rely on
your character statistics to win conflicts in your game. Remember you are creating a story with
your friends, so approach everything in the game in a narrative way. Don’t just say “I attack”,
describe how you are attacking, think outside the box every once-in-a-while, and a good
Narrator will reward clever role-playing.

**Roleplay can progress the game as much as combat (negotiation, lying, buying etc)**
An entire role-play session can be very rewarding even if a single combat dice isn’t rolled. The
main element in a role playing game is the _role-playing_ , not the combat, so don’t expect to
fight every time you play. There are plenty of other challenges and dice rolls that will need to be
done outside of combat and never think that combat is the only way to get out of sticky
situations. Remember the key is to do what your character would do, so if your character would
resolve most conflicts through combat, then go right ahead, but there are many other
character types to play other than battle focused adventurers, and they can be just as
enjoyable.


## Part 2 – Assists

Core Skills, Proficiencies and Vocations can all be used to perform **assist** rolls**.** An assist roll is a
role players can make to (potentially) gain additional dice to aid their primary action/objective.
Assist rolls are made before the action which the player wishes to receive the assist. Assists may
be applied to any logically applicable roll – and the player must first ask the Narrator if the assist
roll is appropriate.

If the player is in a position where a skill they possess would logically assist or grant an advantage
to another skill or combat roll (whether their own or another player’s) the Narrator can assign a
**CL** based on the difficulty of the assist.

If the **assist** check was successful, additional **wins** are added to the result of the skill or combat
roll the player has assisted - equivalent to the amount of wins achieved OVER the Assist **CL** in the
assist check

```
For example:
```
```
3 wins against an assist CL of 3 does nothing to assist the following action, but 4 wins will
grant +1 win to the result of the assisted action’s roll.
```
```
On the other hand, is a player achieves only 1 win in an assist roll of CL 3 , the player will
then face a penalty of - 2 , to be deducted from the result of the assisted action’s roll. This
means that any assist can backfire, and as such carries an element or risk.
```
Each player can only attempt 1 assist each round. This means that if a player has 2 skill that
could logically assist another skill check or combat roll they must choose between those 2 skills.

The amount of wins or losses gained from an assist can never be greater than the challenge
level of the assist. For instance you can only ever receive an additional **3 wins** or **losses** to a skill
or attack that you’re trying to assist if the assist check had was **CL 3**. Likewise an assist check with
a **CL** of **4** will add a cap at max **4 wins** or **losses** depending on the outcome of the assist check.

The **CL** of assists are _never lower than_ **_CL 3_** and the Narrator will determine if the CL is higher
depending on situation and what the player is attempting.

You cannot assist another player when already doing something complex. For example, you
cannot assist a friend fight an enemy while you are trying to pick a lock (though you could still
assist yourself in picking the lock if you have an applicable skill).

When logically applicable, **combat rolls** can actually be used to assist general attribute checks
or skill checks.


```
Example Scenario:
```
```
You wish to make an acrobatics check (CL 4) but the CL is 1 point less than the total
amount of points you have in the Acrobatics skill and in Reflex (5D6) , a hard check to
make – however you also have 2 points in the martial arts proficiency. In this case you
can use you martial arts combat roll (outlined in chapter: combat page 30) to perform
an assist to your acrobatics skill check.
```
```
Your total combat roll is 7 and the narrator sets the assist at CL 3. You roll 5 wins, meaning
you will now receive +2 wins toward the result of your following acrobatics check.
```
```
The acrobatics check is CL 4 and you have 1 point in REF , and 1 in Acrobatics. Added
with your standard base of 3D6, you have 5D6 to roll with in total. You roll 4 wins which
would mean a loss if not for your assist, providing +2 wins making to new total 6 , meaning
through using an assist you have succeeded a difficult Challenge Level!
```
This type of assist from a combat roll can be done with many different combat types
(proficiencies) if logically applicable, such as other weapon proficiencies and magic based
proficiencies.

Within Cogent Roleplay, we don’t outline every applicable situation where a given skill can be
used. It’s up to the players and Narrator to negotiate how these skills can be logically applied to
different circumstances.

Having said this, if you are acting as the Narrator you will find that players will try for some very
thin connections between a given skill they possess and the situation they are in to attempt a skill
check or a possible assist. The players must feel free to express their logic to the Narrator and the
Narrator should listen to all requests fairly – cooperative negotiation is something that the players
and narrator should engage in as it helps the narrative reach new creative levels – but in the
end it will be the narrator’s call and the players must accept what the Narrator decides.


## Chapter 4 – Combat

## Combat Rolls Part 1 – Combat Fundamentals

### COMBAT ROLLS

When a character’s life is on the line, every asset they possess is brought to bear in order to win.
Thus every attribute; strength reflex and intelligence, can be added to the combat roll.

Combat Rolls are calculated by adding:

```
● Base 3D6
● + All attribute points (STR/REF/INT)
● +1D6 for each point in any Combat Applicable Proficiency
(Relevant to what the character is wielding or doing)
● + Any applicable weapon bonus
```
```
For Example:
```
```
Sir Terrik the knight has challenged another knight to a duel. Terrik’s combat roll is
calculated thus:
 base of 3D6 , plus + 1D6 from STR and +1D6 from INT
 2D6 from his two skill points invested in a Medium Sword Proficiency (which can
be applied as he is wielding a medium sword)
 +1D6 from his arming sword (the bonus for a medium weapon)
```
```
His total Combat Roll is 8D6.
```

## Victory Levels.................................................................................................................................

A successful combat roll results in a level of **victory** against your opponent(s). Your combat roll
stands as both an **attack** and **defense**. It represents your character’s overall combative
performance for that round, and not necessarily a single ‘swing’ of their weapon.

Each character’s combat roll is compared to that of the charterer(s) or non-player character(s)
they oppose. Every **win** a character has over another’s roll, means a **level of victory** , from which
they may choose an outcome:

```
Level 1 victory
● Minor Injury, opponent receives – 1 D6 to all physical based dice checks but will
naturally heal over the next few days, or faster if treated actively. This can be
negated by strength or armor.
● Stagger ( - 2D6 for one round)
● Enter into close combat (not available to ranged combat rolls)
```
```
Level 2 victory
● Medium injury – 2 D6 to all physical based dice checks and must be treated
relatively soon, otherwise further penalties may apply (infection etc). This can be
reduced by strength or armor to a lower injury or fully negated.
● Disarm
● Any lower outcome
Level 3 victory
● Serious injury – 3d to all physical based dice checks and the character will die in
time if the wound is untreated. This can be reduced by strength or armor to a
lower injury or fully negated.
● Trip
● Any lower outcome
Level 4 victory
● Fatal injury – 4d to all physical based dice checks, incapacitated, and will die
very soon if untreated. This can be reduced by strength or armor to a lower injury
or fully negated.
● Dismember arm or leg, which also gives a serious injury to the opponent. (not
available to ranged combat rolls unless magic or explosive projectiles are
involved)
● Any lower outcome
Level 5 victory and higher
● Death blow. An instant kill unless the character has a high strength or is wearing
armor and uses them to reduce either the level of victory or injury.
● Any lower outcome
```
Injury levels do not stack in fatality but do stack in dice penalty - meaning two medium injuries
do not equate to a fatal injury where the character will die immediately if untreated, but the
character does receive - 2 D6 to all physical dice checks TWICE, meaning they will have - 4 D6 in
total.

## Fighting Groups

## Fighting Groups

As mentioned, a character’s combat roll stands as both offence defense. If a character is
acting offensively against **several** opponents at once, in one round they are able to engage
against the equivalent to _half their total combat roll, rounded down_. This can mean that larger
weapons (which grant a greater bonus to combat rolls) make it easier to defend against, or
attack and hit, multiple opponents.

Ranged weapons usually cannot achieve victories against more than one opponent per round
(this is dependent on setting and allowances from the Narrator, for example; a fully automatic
machine gun can hit multiple opponents in a single round, see Hardcore Ranged Rules, page
49 ). However, a ranged combat roll still stands as a defense against more than one incoming
attack; indeed any character can defend against a number of opponents in a single round.

```
For Example:
```
```
Sir Terrik is fighting two goblins. Terrik has a combat roll of 8D6. This also means that Terrik is
capable of defending against, and achieving victories against, a maximum of 4
adjacent opponents in a single round.
```
```
The two goblins he has engaged each have combat rolls of 7D6 (base 3 D6, + 2 D6 REF,
+ 1 D6 from medium swords proficiency and + 1 D6 from their medium weapons).
```
```
One of the goblins rolls 4 wins and the other rolls 5 wins.
```
```
Terrik rolls 4 wins.
```
```
This means that he matched one of the goblin’s rolls but was beaten by the other. The
Goblin chooses to inflict a minor injury with its level 1 victory against Terrick.
```
```
The next round Terrick rolls 6 wins with his recalculated combat roll (a total of 7D6, due to
his injury inflicting -1D6), and the goblins each roll 3 wins.
```
```
Terrik achieves a level three victory against both goblins and he chooses to inflict a
serious injury to each.
```
```
As a serious injury will kill a character if not treated in the near future, the goblins retreat
leaving a trail of blood.
```
## Defense Rolls

## Defense Rolls

A Defense Roll is a variant of the Combat Roll. It is used when a character is either in a position
where they cannot perform any type of Combat Maneuver to their opponent (E.g. too far away
from an opponent using a ranged weapon against them while only armed with a melee
weapon), or they want a greater chance to survive as their standard Combat Roll is too low
(fleeing after receiving an injury).

A Defense Roll is calculated in the same way as the **Combat Roll** but adds an additional **+2D6** to
roll with. _No matter the result of the Defense Roll, the character cannot achieve a level of victory_
because the character was purely focused on protecting themselves, and not on attacking.


## Combat Actions

Combat is run in a **Round by Round** format. Each character can perform **1 action** within a round
(usually a combat roll) with liberties in regard to the narrative flow of the game. For instance it
doesn’t take an action to shout out something to another character while fighting a monster,
though it would take a round to explain something complicated.

Narrator mustn’t time a player’s dialogue to make sure it falls within restrictive timing. Remember
narrative flow will make things run far smoother if you are a little relaxed in regard to things like
this, while still having limits - you wouldn’t want to let a player pass on huge amounts of
information in a single round, in the middle of a battlefield. In those cases you might say
something like, “it will take several rounds to explain everything you want”.

Round by Round combat isn’t played using any grids, timers, boards or miniatures, though
sometimes a rough map or drawing of a room or location may help. There isn’t a strict distance
characters can move within a round, this is left up to Narrator’s and player’s own reasoning. A
player with higher agility, strength and athletics skill would be able to run faster and farther than
another player with less, and it doesn’t take that much thought to figure out how far a person
can run within a round.

Actions in combat rounds are not solely movements and attacks. A combat action can really
be anything a person could do within a few seconds, such as turning over a table, swinging from
a chandelier, or dropping a boulder onto an enemy. The Narrative flow you develop while
playing will guide you in what the players can do in game, and how long it will take to do it.

## Round Order

Every action within **Round by Round** conflicts happen almost at the same time or in direct
succession of one another. This means that one character’s action is NOT explicitly followed by
another character’s action. It should be considered as everything happening together.

To make sense of this potential ‘chaos’, there is a declaration phase and a performance phase.

**Declaration phase**

The Character with **lowest reflex declares** what they are doing first. That might seem odd as you
could think characters with higher reflex should get to move first – but this is the declaration
phase - no one is moving yet. If two Characters have the same agility, they each roll **1D6** , where
the highest resulting roll gets to declare **later** for **the rest of the combat encounter**.

```
Players who declare LATER hold an ADVANTAGE in combat.
```
Once a player has declared what they are going to perform, they cannot change their mind.
They are locked into performing that action in this round. The players who declare after another
can chose an action that counters or complements the declared action of another character.

This means that characters with highest Reflex can see or react to what their opponents are
going to do.


```
For Example:
```
```
Leon, a player character, is dueling Dartane, a non-player character. It’s a new combat
round and Dartain has a lower Reflex than Leon so he must declare his action first.
```
```
Dartain declares that he intends to jump on top of a table to get a height advantage
against Leon, ready for his attack. Leon, knowing Dartain’s intent declares that he wishes
to knock the table over whilst Dartain jumps on top of it.
```
**Performance phase**

Once all characters have declared their action, they make their rolls. Though things mostly
happen simultaneously within the round, it’s sometimes important to know which blade landed
before another, or who managed to perform their action a little bit faster than another. In these
situations, the character with higher reflex will always win.

```
For Example:
```
```
The Narrator decides that it will be a standard combat action for Leon to knock over the
table but Leon won’t receive his weapon bonus for this action as he is using a rapier
which isn’t suited for knocking over tables (if Leon was using something heavy like a
greataxe, it could be used to smash down on the side of the table to knock it over and
the weapon bonus might be appropriate).
```
```
Leon’s roll is a base of 3 D6 , + 2 D6 for his points in Reflex, making 5 dice to roll with in total.
```
```
The player controlling Leon asks the narrator if he can apply his acrobatics skill. The
narrator agrees, giving Leon a further +2D6 (7D6 total).
```
```
Leon rolls his 7 dice, resulting in 4 wins. These 4 wins become the CL his opponent,
Dartain, must match in order to succeed his declared action and remain on his feet.
```
```
The Narrator instructs Dartain to make an acrobatics check to jump on the table. Under
normal circumstances (un-opposed) this would have been easy, requiring a CL of 1 , but
now Dartain must make an acrobatics check against CL 4 , quite difficult for a skill check.
```
```
If Dartain succeeds his action, he will have an advantage in the next round of combat
(higher ground), and If he fails, he will have a disadvantage (staggered, or prone,
depending on the roll, see Combat Modifies, Page 38).
```
Where ‘declaration’ happens in reverse (slowest players declare first), during ‘performance’, the
order is reversed, players with the fastest Reflex in that encounter acting out their intentions first.

```
SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH.6
Combat Priority Guide
```

## Melee VS. Ranged

The advantage with melee is that your single offensive combat roll can inflict injury to several
opponents that did not match your combat roll.

The advantage with ranged fighting, is that no combat maneuver can be performed against
you so long as your opponent it not is adjacent to you. Melee combatants, no matter how high
their combat roll, cannot inflict injury unless they are close enough. One common disadvantage
with many ranged weapons however, is that no matter how high your combat roll, you can only
inflict injury to **one** opponent each round.

## Armor

Armor can be used to **reduce injury level** (not victory level, which only Strength can reduce).
Wearing lots of armor will also add **weight** which negatively affects a player’s combat roll.

Armor levels are set by the type of armor the character is wearing, described below. In the case
of shields, the armor rating stacks with worn armor. A character wearing full plate (4 armor) and
using a shield (2 armor) will have an armor rating of 6. This is the highest armor rating in the
game, but will also remove **- 3 D6** from their combat roll.

```
PLEASE NOTE: Injury reduction from armor is not applicable while in Close Combat
(See Combat Modifiers, page 38 )
```
```
Armor level 1
```
```
Leather armor
Gambeson (padded)
Chain shirt (hauberk)
```
```
Armor level 2
(-1d to combat roll)
```
```
Breastplate
Full Chainmail
Shield
```
```
Armor level 4
(-2d to combat roll)
```
```
Full plate armor
```
A character can reduce injury levels by the equivalent amount of levels they have in armor, per
combat encounter. When another fight begins (another combat encounter) the character’s
pre-set injury reduction from their armor level is reset.


```
For Example:
```
```
Victoria is a noble knight and is attacked unawares by a backstabbing rogue.
```
```
The rogue achieves a level 3 victory and chooses to inflict a serious injury. Victoria is
wearing full plate armor and can reduce up to 4 points of injury throughout this conflict.
```
```
Reducing this serious injury by 3 points times will negate it; one to reduce it to a medium
injury, a second to reduce it further to a minor injury, and another to remove the injury
entirely.
```
```
Victoria chooses to do so, which will leave her one last injury reduction from her armor
for that combat encounter, but enable to fight without such a disadvantage. She will
however, be fighting with - 2D6 to her combat roll due to her heavy armor.
```
When achieving a victory in combat you can choose to inflict an injury - but if your opponent is
wearing armor choosing to inflict an injury will be more easily countered through their injury
reduction. However, other actions chosen through a victory, such as **staggering** , **disarming** or
**tripping** an armored opponent, cannot be negated with armor, see Combat Modifies, Page 38).

```

please see Chapter 6 : Hardcore Combat
```
```

Armor Guide
```
## Weapon Modifiers

Each weapon inherently provides advantages over other weapons. The following is a guide and
can be altered as the Narrator sees fit.

**Ranged** (bows, crossbows etc.)
**+2D6 weapon bonus at range**

**- 3 D6 in melee combat**

```
Unarmed
```
**- 1D6** unless wearing some type of hand protection such a bracers or gauntlets, in
which case there is no change in dice.
**Disarming Bonus**
    ● Can be used in close combat and receives bonus in disarming actions. A
       player must be in close combat to disarm another player while being
       unarmed.
    ● Once in close combat, if declaring to attempt a disarm, the player
       receives **+4D6** to their combat roll, but the roll cannot be used to inflict
       any other injury victory (this mean they cannot delegate their attack to
       inflict an injury or execute a trip regardless of how high the attack roll is).


```
Small weapons (Daggers, Hatchets, Shortsword etc.)
No change in dice, but can be used in close combat
```
```
Medium weapons (Arming sword, Battle axe, Warhammer etc.)
+1D6 weapon bonus
```
```
Large weapons (Longsword, two-handed axe, short poleaxe etc.)
+2D6 weapon bonus
```
```
Reach weapons (spear, Halberd, Greatsword, long poleaxe etc.)
+3D6 weapon bonus
Reach is a significant advantage in combat, and is reflected in the higher
weapon bonuses - but the Narrator is free to negate all dice bonuses if they feel
the reach weapon would not work as effectively due to narrow confines such as
an alleyway or hallway.
 Medium weapons and smaller can be used to enter into close combat
against any character using reach weapons (see close combat under
combat modifiers).
```
```
Hand ballistic (Handguns, hand SMGs etc.)
+2D6 weapon bonus at range
```
**- 3 D6 in melee combat**

```
Shoulder stocked ballistic (Rifles, shoulder stocked SMGs, fully automatic rifles etc.)
+4D6 weapon bonus at medium range
```
**- 4 D6 in melee combat**

```
Heavy ballistic (Bazookas, heavy machine guns, miniguns etc.)
+6D6 weapon bonus at range
Cannot be used in melee combat
```

Cogent Roleplay, please see **chapter six: Hardcore rules**

### Part 2 – Circumstantial Variants

### COMBAT MODIFIERS

There are many circumstances in combat where a player would logically receive either a bonus
or penalty to their combat roll. Below are some examples of standard combat modifiers and if a
player feels they should receive a bonus that is not covered by the following suggestions they
are free to request the bonus from Narrator and the Narrator will make the final choice. Likewise
the Narrator is free to impose a penalty not covered in the following examples if they feel it is
applicable.

**Dual wielding**

```
Dual wielding does not give an additional combat roll in a round. What it does is grant
an additional dice bonus depending on the weight of the second weapon being used.
To duel wield the character must have at least one proficiency point in both of the
weapons being used to receive any bonus.
```
```
Small secondary weapon
+2D6 to all combat rolls
Medium secondary weapon
+1D6 to all combat rolls
```
```
PLEASE NOTE: If you are dual wielding, your combat roll is made up using the proficiency
and/or weapon bonus of your primary weapon, NOT any proficiencies or weapon
bonuses for BOTH weapons.
```
```
For Example:
```
```
Kelvin wields a Rapier and a Dagger. His attack role is made up as such:
```
```
 base of 3D6 , plus + 1D6 from INT and +1D6 from REF
 2D6 from his two skill points invested in a Medium Sword Proficiency
 +1D6 from his rapier weapon bonus (the bonus for a medium weapon)
 +2D6 for the dagger he is also wielding (this bonus can ONLY be added because
Kelvin has at least one point in the Small Weapon proficiency)
```
```
If Kelvin were to be disarmed from his primary weapon in combat, he will lose any dual
wielding bonus, and must revert to the dagger as his primary weapon until his rapier is
recovered.
```

**Close Combat**

```
‘Close combat’ means the fight is so close in physical proximity that the character’s
bodies are pressed up against each other in a grapple or wrestle. Being in close combat
negates the use of larger weapons and thus the weapon bonuses of any weapon,
medium and larger, are lost when in close combat.
```
```
In this scenario, a character using a medium (or larger) weapon is considered ‘unarmed’
and as such will receive any applicable penalties.
```
```
Entering into close combat is a maneuver which minimally requires victory level 1.
```
```
Injury reduction from armor is not applicable while in close combat.
```
```
Additionally, you can use a medium weapon in close combat if your opponent is using a
reach weapon.
```
**Circumstantial modifiers**

```
High ground = +2D6
Bonus received through achieving a height advantage against an opponent, IE standing
on a table, riding on a mount etc.
```
```
Flank = + 2 D6
Bonus received when attacking an opponent actively engaged in something else, IE
attacking another character, picking a lock, etc.
```
```
Staggered = - 2D6 (one round)
Penalty received if the opponent selects to stagger through a victory level, or if the
Narrator applies it, IE sand is thrown in a character face, or they slip on oil, etc.
```
```
Off guard = CL in lieu of defense roll , CL determined by Narrator
IE, attacking a soldier from behind may require a successful ‘Stealth’ check, then the
attack (which they cannot defend against) will be a CL assigned by the Narrator, which
the player will roll against with a normal combat roll (without a flanking bonus). Any wins
achieved over the CL counts towards the level of victory. Failing the CL commences the
next round of combat, where the opponent is then engaged.
```
```
Lying down / Prone = - 4D6
Penalty lasts for one round or until the character readies themselves, unless they are
incapacitated/sleeping. In combat, the penalty counts as taking place during the
action of getting up while defending.
```
```
Unequal equipment = how unequal the difference
In combat or out of combat, the task will be much more difficult if the character is not
equipped to do so. Picking a lock is much more difficult without lock picks but not
impossible. A master lock picker might be able to improvise. Killing a person with a stick is
much harder than with a sword. If a character is attempting to perform a task without
the appropriate tool, the Narrator assigns an appropriate bonus or penalty to the player,
which they must apply when rolling against the CL or when in combat.
```

```
Distance = -dice based on excessive distance according to the weapon being used
A thrown axe will receive greater penalties at distance then a longbow
```
```
Charge = +1D6
If there is enough distance between the character and opponent, they may ‘charge’,
adding momentum to their attack.
```
```
Brace = +2 wins to a combat roll against a Charge
A brace is a move purely to counter a charge and can only be done if they have fast
enough reflex, or a full round before the charge to prepare. A character with a higher
reflex will be able to declare their action after a player who declares their charge.
Bracing uses the opponent’s charge momentum against them, enabling a prepared
defender to more easily stagger, trip or injure the charging opponent.
```
```
For Example:
```
```
A troll charged Marcus with a combat roll of 6D6 , +1D6 for the charge.
```
```
Marcus, being aware of this due to his higher Reflex, will brace against the attack with his
combat roll of 7D6.
```
```
The troll rolls a total of 4 wins , and Marcus rolls a total of 3 wins , +2 additional wins due to
his high reflex allowing him to brace against the charge. If he were slower to react,
Marcus may have been injured in the charge, but due to bracing he is now able to
either stagger or injure his opponent.
```
```
PLEASE NOTE: You may further reinforce your ‘brace’ by making the entire action
‘defense’, gaining a further +2D6, however no victory levels can be achieved in doing so
```
**Incapacitated**
If a character is incapacitated, they are held in place, tied up, or unconscious and
therefore cannot fight back or defend themselves. Armor levels are disregarded and the
**CL** a character must exceed to obtain **ANY victory level against them** is **1**.

```
SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH.9
Combat Modifiers
```

**Ranged weapons vs melee**

Guns and bows are meant to be used at range and don’t perform well in melee combat. If a
character using melee weapons wants to engage in combat against an opponent using
ranged, the character with the ranged weapon will incur the standard penalty as described in
weapon modifiers, but not right away. The character using the melee weapon must close the
distance and the narrator will determine how many rounds this will take (it might not take any
rounds if the character is close enough).

In the first round where the Melee combatant gets to attack, the ranged combatant might still
**not** receive the ascribed penalty, **if** they have higher reflex.

If the melee combatant has higher reflex and is close enough they can close the distance to a
combatant using a ranged weapon before they can fire. In this instance the ranged combatant
received the appropriate penalty for using ranged weapons in melee combat. Also the
combatant using the ranged weapon can only injure the melee combatant attacking them if
they declared that they were aiming for that combatant in the declaration phase (they might
have been aiming for another person), for ranged weapons can only achieve victories against
one opponent in a round.

If ranged combatant was aiming for someone else, their attack can still hit whoever they were
aiming for with no reduction to their roll, but when comparing their roll against anyone attacking
them in melee combat, their combat roll is reduced by the weapon type.


## Part 3 – Chases

Chases are far more common than you might think. Just watch any action movie and see if
there’s a chase scene (there usually is).

In Cogent, chases begin by the Narrator setting a **distance level out of 3 categories** to the
characters in the chase, those being a **close distance** , **medium distance** , or **long distance**.

At a **Close Distance** , the characters engaged in the chase are relatively near each other, but
not near enough to engage in combat without ranged weapons. Narrators must keep ‘relativity’
in mind when deciding on a level of distance - a Close Distance in a car chase might be
considered far away for a chase on foot.

When **on foot** , the characters use the **athletics skill** to make chase rolls.

When **using a vehicle** (including mounts) the characters use their **ride/pilot skill**.

From the initial distance set by the narrator, the players roll against each other using the
applicable skill (athletics or ride/pilot). Please note that other skills, vocations and proficiencies
can be used to assist the chase role, such as using acrobatics to jump and weave through
obstacles to lose your pursuer.

If the pursuer wins the chase roll, the distance between the characters is reduced. If a pursuer
wins the chase roll against the target in a close distance, the pursuer ‘catches’ those trying to
flee.

If the characters trying to flee win the chase roll, the distance between them and their pursuers
increases until a successful roll at a long distance, whereupon the characters have successfully
fled.

When the distance is closed, the target trying to flee were literally stopped, IE their horse can be
tripped over, dismounting the target, or their car was run into a tree or wall, damaged so it no
longer functions – or they ran into a corner with no easy escape or they were tripped up and are
now prone.

The level or severity in how the characters were stopped will depend on how severely they failed
the final chase roll. The narrator might even use a destiny roll to determine how bad.

Narrators should use chase scenes as an opportunity to bring excitement to the narrative. Be
careful not to let chase scenes become a simple turn-by-turn scenario of “you get closer” or
“you get farther away”. Instead, describe the obstacles, and make it difficult and exciting.


## Chapter 5 – Narration (The Destiny Roll)

```
As this is the very first version of the Alpha of the Cogent Roleplay system, there is much that can
be added to these chapters, in particular this chapter on Narration. For now, we will simply
encourage Narrators to be inventive, focus on engaging the players through descriptiveness
and making sure all participants get equal time.
```
```
Beyond these things, it is the Narrator’s role to guide the story and provide the fun (no pressure!),
and sometimes even Narrators need a little help to keep things fresh and avoid claims of bias
towards specific outcomes.
```
```
It is for these reasons, that we use a mechanic called the Destiny Roll.
```
### THE DESTINY ROLL

```
So far untouched in the text of this manual, the Destiny Roll stands alone as an extremely
powerful and dynamic storytelling tool. A destiny roll is made by a 20 sided dice , or D20 , and is
made by the Narrator, or assigned by the Narrator to be made by a player.
```
```
This roll can be applied to endless scenarios, and is used to allow the Narrator to let fate – the roll
of a dice – to decide what direction the story will move on in, be that for or against the players
goals and desires.
```
```
The higher the roll is, and the closer the roll is to 20 , the more advantageous the result is to the
player(s). Adversely, the lower the roll and the closer it is to 1 , the worse the disadvantage.
Furthermore, rolling a 20 is considered a critical success , and may allow the Narrator to assign
exceptionally advantageous circumstances to the party or player. Likewise, rolling a 1 is always
to be considered a critical failure , and will result in all kinds of things the players won’t want.
Whether they be revealed as immediate or delayed consequences is up to the Narrator.
```
```
These rolls may be used in situations of great intensity, to help the Narrator guide the path of the
action. They may be used to help break up monotony at random times to see if something good
or bad encounters the player, or even what the weather is (see Weather stuff Page #), and they
may also be used to determine the intensity of consequence of a players choice.
```
```
Here are a few simple examples of the Destiny Roll in action:
```
**Scenario Destiny roll <5 Destiny roll between 6- 14 Destiny roll >15
A battle has been waging
for several rounds, and the
enemy is about to unveil a
new threat...**

```
A colossal dragon,
loosely chained and
ready to attack
anything in sight!
```
```
A squad of angry soldiers
led by a menacing
captain!
```
A siege weapon
preparing to fire, but
it seems to be
constructed late, and
might fall apart
**The players enter an alley
and are greeted by...**

```
A gang of thieves,
with weapons drawn!
```
```
The town drunk, who looks
at you with seductive eyes
```
An attractive nurse
leaving a homestead
**You fall through the floor
into the room below...**

```
A dungeon, with no
apparent means of
escape...
```
```
A courthouse, whereupon
several officials gasp in
surprise!
```
```
A whorehouse which
has been desperate
for new customers!
```

## Chapter 6 – Hardcore Combat

We have made cogent to be as simple as possible but in doing so, we also understand that
sometimes simplicity comes to the detriment of realism and sophistication. In the cases where
we have seen that further refinement of the rules may more accurately reflect real and satisfying
combat, we have made a hardcore variant of that specific rule system and provided them
below. These have been created with consideration to more advanced role-players and people
with an interest in more versatile and complex combat mechanics.


### Hardcore Armor rules

The hardcore armor rules make armor significantly more powerful and reflect reality better.
Armor levels are calculated by adding the armor ratings of each specific piece of armor being
worn, which will then give the character their total Armor level.
**Armor also adds weight which affects combat. Half the players total armor level (rounded down)
is subtracted from their total combat roll.**

A character can then reduce injury levels by the equivalent amount of levels they have in
armor.

The pre-set injury reduction that armor provides is permanent and applies to every injury the
player receives in every combat encounter, meaning the only way to injure an opponent in
armor is to exceed their armor score, or bypass it. In these circumstances the most efficient ways
of defeating a person in armor is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just
like in real life.

Having said this, the hardcore armor rules are only truly balanced in the game mechanics if the
Narrator and Players are also employing the **hardcore weapon modifiers**. Without the hardcore
weapon modifiers it will be very difficult, too impossible, to injure an opponent with a significantly
high armor rating (unless you immobilize them or employ other combat modifiers). A level eight
victory is VERY hard to achieve, which would be needed to inflict even a minor injure to an
opponent with an armor score of 7.

Below are the armor categories and if applicable in the setting a character can wear two
pieces of armor in the same category, such as wearing a gambeson under chainmail or a
breastplate, which was most certainly done in history. When this happens the armor ratings
stack, which is not necessarily a good thing as a higher armor rating subtracts more from a
character’s combat roll.

The ratings as given are a guide and the Narrators can change this as they wish to make armor
more or less significant in their game.

```
Armor categories Armor level
```
```
Small Shield (buckler) 1
Medium shield (Heater Shield, Targe, Small
Viking shield)
```
#### 2

```
Large shield (Kite Shield, Scutum, large
Viking shield)
```
#### 3

```
Helmet 1
Upper body protection , Breastplate and
fauld, gambeson, Chainmail hauberk,
Kevlar
```
#### 1

```
Arm protection , Pauldrons, arms and
gauntlets
```
#### 1

```
Leg protection , Cuisses and greaves 1
```

### Hardcore Weapon Modifiers

These hardcore weapon rules are a little more sophisticated and are completely optional.
Having said that, these rules are made to companion the hardcore armor rules and balances
the game mechanics while reflecting reality better.

These modifiers are made to reflect the true characteristics of individual weapons because even
though a mace and an arming sword are both one handed weapons, they are severely
different in use and effectiveness in different combative circumstances, like fighting an
opponent in armor. Thus these rules break down weapons farther into more specific categories.

Also the hardcore weapon bonuses allows for weapons to be used in multiple ways. For instance
a poleaxe has a hammer head as well as an axe head and a long spike, allowing it to be used
as a reach hafted blunt, reach hafted blade or a Reach hafted point, weapon. The player must
specify in what way they are using their weapon to the Narrator and cannot backtrack. If the
player doesn't specify in which way they are using their weapon it is assumed they were using
the weapon in their standard function.

```
Unarmed
```
- 1d unless wearing some type of hand protection such a bracers or gauntlets. In
this case there is no change to dice. Can be used in close combat and receives
bonus in disarms.
Disarming
    ● A player must be in close combat to disarm another player while being
       unarmed.
    ● Once in close combat, if declaring to attempt a disarm before the round
       begins, the player receives +4d in their attack roll but the roll cannot be
       used for any victory (this mean they cannot delegate their attack to inflict
       an injury or execute a trip regardless of how high the victory achieved).
**Thrown weapons** Throwing dagger, shuriken

### Hardcore ranged rules

There’s a difference in how ranged weapons operate when comparing things like guns to bows.
To reflect this we have added an optional rule system that can be used when employing ballistic
weapons.

_WARNING:_ these rules are called hardcore for a reason. It is VERY easy to die when using these
rules, just like in real life when dealing with ballistic weapons. If these rules are not used when
employing ballistic weapons the players will have an active chance to defend against ballistic
attacks, such as dodging. While this isn’t realistic it does convey a superhuman level of
combative skill and if that is the campaign you want to play, the regular rule system will work
perfectly. Indeed both these rule systems can be used, the regular people having to follow the
hardcore rules while the exceptionally skilled/superhuman/scientifically advanced people get to
follow the regular combat rules.

The key difference in the hardcore rules is that ranged combat rolls are done against static
**Challenge Levels** determined by distance and size of the target. Their total combat roll is
calculated exactly the same, except that they are not trying to beat another player’s roll. Every
win over the CL stands as a level of victory the player achieves against their opponent. Those
attacked by weapons that use the hardcore rules cannot make any defense roll at all. Ballistic
weapons (or other similar weapons like laser guns) work differently to, say, bows, because one
cannot actively defend against a fired bullet. They can prepare before the gun is fired such as
ducking behind cover or wearing armor, but once the gun is fired and its aim was true, you’ll get
hit.

close enough). For every dice they exceed the CL they can hit another
person but the dice result doesn’t determine the level of injury to anyone
hit. All persons hit roll to see what level of injury they receive.
Scoped weapons
When using the scope on a weapon every CL for close medium and long
range targets are determined according to the close range category.

## Chapter 7 – Supplementary Content

```
The goal in creating Cogent Roleplay, has been to create a roleplay system as simple and
diverse as possible. In doing so, we understand that, though applications of such as system may
be endless, many players enjoy using classic roleplay settings like Medieval Fantasy.
```
We have created some examples of supplementary rules that can be used for some of the more
oft-used settings, while providing them to you as an example of how you can supplement the
Cogent system with your own ideas!

```
We don’t claim that these supplementary rules are perfectly balanced to universally applicable,
but we do hope that they provide a solid example to you for how to apply the system in ways
most suited to your own needs.
```
## Part 1 – Example Magic System

Please note that even though this system is, as of yet, unfinished, it can still be used as the system
works off a CL basis. All the player has to do is describe what they wish to do with their spell and
the narrator will decide if the spell applies to the action the player is requesting to perform, and
then set the CL they must match in order to cast it.

This simple pre-built magic system is meant to demonstrate how magic can be incorporated into
the Cogent System. It is made to reflect classic fantasy and can be used in you settings or used
as an example for one that you make for yourself.
We do recommend that you at least use the individual spells as models for other superpowers or
magic systems that you might want to incorporate. For instance the rules and CLs for the
Telepathy spell as outlined below works perfectly for a superheroes’ telepathy superpower. Feel
free to take and rename what you wish.

**Example Classic Fantasy Magic system**

Each spell is an individual proficiency that a player can spend up to two skill points in. They are
decently versatile and there’s no limit to the amount of times they can be used.

Each spell falls into one or more of the schools or disciplines of magic (wizardry, sorcery, etc) and
a player must select a school before they choose any spells to know. It does not cost anything to
choose a school of magic but once a school is chosen the player can only select spells from
that specific school. This is because each school of magic draws its power from different sources
(really it’s for additional game balance and to remain true to the classic fantasy tropes).

Of course if the narrator feels that a specific skill fits more with a different school of magic they
are more than free to mix and match as they see fit.

The player can choose how to use the spell so long as it falls within the spells guidelines and the
Narrator will assign a CL (based on the standard Challenge Level difficulties, 1 common task, 2
uncommon, 3 specialized, etc.) that must be matched for the spell to be cast. This means
there’s an element of failure in using magic. Failure according to this magic system never means
the spell was not cast, it means the spell was miscast, meaning something other than what the


player wanted to happen occurred. The level of failure from the CL will ascribe how great a
miscast it was and the narrator will fill in the rest.

### Sorcery spells (proficiencies)

**Pyromancy**

```
This spell creates and controls fire. It can be used in all the varied and versatile
ways that fire can.
This spell can also be used offensively as a base combat roll. The amount of fire
that the sorcerer wants to create will determine the CL, set by the Narrator.
```
```
Can summon elementals according to the summoning CL table below.
Please note that the amount of wins exceeding the CL will determine how long
the elemental will remain in the physical plane.
```
```
Matching the CL= three rounds
+1 over the CL= ten rounds
+2 over the CL = One hour
+3 over the CL = six hours
+4 over the CL = a day
+5 over the CL = Will say with the Sorcerer until dismissed
```
```
Rolling under the CL will cause the elemental to attack the sorcerer and it will
remain in the world for the equivalent amount of losses under the CL as wins over
the CL determines.

Elementals can only be damaged by other elemental based attacks (they are
immune to their own element), magic attacks and receive double damage from
attacks by their opposing element. When elementals are struck by a damage
type that can harm them, they receive damaged in the same way as any other
creature and character, meaning in injury severity from combat maneuvers.
```

**Hydromancy**

Creates and controls water, the amount and level of control will set the CL
determined by the narrator.

Can summon elementals according to the summoning CL table below
Please note that the amount of wins exceeding the CL will determine how long
the elemental will remain in the physical plane.

Matching the CL= three rounds
+1 over the CL= ten rounds

immune to their own element), magic attacks and receive double damage from
attacks by their opposing element. When elementals are struck by a damage
type that can harm them, they receive damaged in the same way as any other
creature and character, meaning in injury severity from combat maneuvers.

**Aeromancy**

Control air, fly, and created gusts of wind.
Aeromancy cannot be used as a base combat proficiency though it can be
used to push on people and blow them over.
Aeromancy cannot be used to levitate things, it is to wild and strong for such
delicate and controlled movement. Flying through Aeromancy is achieved by


thickening the air under the magic user and pushing it past in the direction you
want to fly, thus the magic user looks to be in the midst of a windstorm that is
solely localized around themselves. This cannot be done to another person or
object as thickening the air like this is exponentially harder the farther away from
the caster.

```
CL 2 ● Fly at standard sprinting speed. Failure does not
mean you fall from the sky, but that you lose
control and fly in an undesired direction.
CL 4 ● Fly at speeds up to 100 km. Failure does not
mean you fall from the sky, but that you lose
control and fly in an undesired direction.
CL 6 ● Fly at speeds up to 500 km. Failure does not
mean you fall from the sky, but that you lose
control and fly in an undesired direction.
```
If using this spell to create a strong gust of wind to knock another player or NPC
off their feet, the caster makes a conflict dice roll with their Aeromancy
proficiency vs another player/NPC defense roll. Weapon bonuses cannot be
used in the defense roll against this type of attack

Aeromancy can summon elementals according to the summoning CL table
below
Please note that the amount of wins exceeding the CL will determine how long
the elemental will remain in the physical plane.

### Wizardry spells (proficiencies)

**Divination**

```
Read someone’s future, see through a focusing object (like a crystal ball or calm
pool of water) to spy on people or places far away. Communicate over long
distances. Prophesy, be warned of danger or traps that lay in wait ahead.
Basically divination can be used to assist, perception checks, or supplant
perception checks if higher, and not be limited by things that are hidden. Of
course the farther away things are the higher CL the Narrator will apply.
```
**Levitation**

```
Any object of human size and lower doesn’t take a dice check to control unless
you are trying to do one of two things:
▪ Hold another person still who is actively trying to resist. In that case it is a Conflict
CL.
▪ Manipulate something at a distance or something heavier than normal human
size and weight.
You can manipulate weapons and attack with them as if you were holding them
but you do not use your Telekinesis Proficiency in the attack roll. Instead you use
whatever proficiency that weapon requires.
Using levitation to thrown things as projectiles uses your levitation proficiency
The following CLs are to be used for the specified actions
CL1 ● Manipulate something within 10 meters under human size
and weight
CL 3 ● Manipulate something within 10 meters and up to car size
and weight
● Manipulate something from 10 – 20 meters away under
human size and weight
CL 5 ● Manipulate something within 10 meters and up to bus size
and weight
● Manipulate something from 10 – 20 meters away up to
car size and weight
● Manipulate something from 20 - 50 meters away under
human size and weight
CL 7 ● Manipulate something within 10 meters and up to
airplane size and weight
● Manipulate something from 10 – 20 meters away up to
bus size and weight
● Manipulate something from 20 - 50 meters away up to
car size and weight
● Manipulate something from 50 - 100 meters away under
human size and weight
```

**Telepathy**

No dice checks are required when trying to read or communicate to a non-
resisting person’s mind. A player or NPC can try and resist telepathy with an
intelligence roll or even their own Telepathy proficiency. If a person is resisting you
must exceed their roll to read what they are thinking, exceed their roll by 2 to
probe their mind and look for specific thoughts or memories and exceed their
role by 4 to inflict an injury level. Each dice beyond the four is an additional injury
level inflicted.

**Counter-Spell**

With this spell the wizard can counter any other spell from any other type of
magic. Countering a spell can do one of two things:
If the Counter Spell roll was equal to the roll of the spell it’s trying to counter it can
prevent the spell from being cast.
If the Counter Spell roll is greater than the spell it is trying to counter the wizard
casting the Counter Spell can choose for the spell they are countering to be
miscast (see miscast above). The level of miscast depends on how much the
wizard exceeded the spell roll of the spell they are countering.

**Teleportation**

Self-teleportation - This is the ability to teleport yourself (no other objects) to
desired locations. Please note that all CLs are doubled if trying to teleport to an
unseen location
CL 2 ● Teleport yourself within 10 meters to seen
location
CL 4 ● Teleport yourself within 10 meters and up to car
size and weight to seen location
● Teleport yourself from 10 – 20 meters away
under human size and weight to seen location
CL 6 ● Teleport yourself within 10 meters and up to bus
size and weight to seen location
● Teleport yourself from 10 – 20 meters away up to
car size and weight to seen location
● Teleport yourself from 20 - 50 meters away under
human size and weight to seen location
CL 9 ● Teleport yourself within 10 meters and up to
airplane size and weight to seen location
● Teleport yourself from 10 – 20 meters away up to
bus size and weight to seen location
● Teleport yourself from 20 - 50 meters away up to
car size and weight to seen location
● Teleport yourself from 50 - 100 meters away
under human size and weight to seen location

Other teleportation - This is the ability to teleport other objects, not oneself to
desired locations. You must be able to see the object to teleport it. If you are


teleporting something close to you to a distant location, always use the farthest
distance to determine the CL. Please note that all CLs are doubled if trying to
teleport something to an unseen location

```
CL 5 ● Teleport something 10 meters away from its
location under human size and weight
CL 7 ● Teleport something 10 meters away from its
location up to car size and weight
● Teleport something from 10 – 20 meters away
from its location under human size and weight
CL 9 ● Teleport something within 10 meters away from
its location and up to bus size and weight
● Teleport something from 10 – 20 meters away
from its location up to car size and weight
● Teleport something from 20 - 50 meters away
from its location under human size and weight
CL 12 ● Teleport something within 10 meters away from
its location and up to airplane size and weight
● Teleport something from 10 – 20 meters away
from its location up to bus size and weight
● Teleport something from 20 - 50 meters away
from its location up to car size and weight
● Teleport something from 50 - 100 meters away
from its location under human size and weight
to seen location
```
**Prestidigitation**

```
Create soft light
Reduce soft heat/cold
Tiny illusion
Create fog
Create a protective shield of magic
Small magical tricks
```
**Illusion**
Invisibility is included in illusion


### Witchcraft spells (proficiencies)

**Alteration**

```
Can change the composition of an element or change it into a lighter element.
Making something into a lighter element will increase it’s size. It is possible to
change something into a heavier element but requires much more power and
exhausts the witch more. The heavier the change the harder it is.
Transform objects
This is complex and requires a lot of power. Using this spell will usually drain the
witch for a day
Chemical effects in substances can be completely reversed through alteration,
such as altering a poison into a life saving, injury healing potion.
```
**Polymorph**

```
Transform people and themselves into other creatures. The greater the difference
from the original form, the greater the CL
```
**Domination**

```
To work this spell the Witch needs a physical thing representing their target, a doll
that has a fingernail or lock of hair from the person they wish to dominate.
This spell begins with manipulating the emotions in their target, then being able to
plant thoughts and ideas into their minds and ultimately taking over their body for
a few rounds. The Narrator will set the CL for each different application of this
spell.
```
**Sympathy**

```
This magic bonds two things and then can switch properties between the two,
such as passing on the properties of one thing to the other making the other,
weaker, stronger, lighter or heavier.
When two things are linked or bonded through sympathy, with a high enough CL
their physical locations can be switched, no matter their location. And ultimately
through sympathy, two bonded creatures can have their consciousness switched
either temporarily, or permanently.
```

### Druidism spells

**Naturmancy**

```
Can control non intelligent living things, cause trees to move and vines to snare,
or wood to warp.
Cause a natural element to harden or soften, wood stronger then steel, steel
softer then butter) (causes thing to decay including people, or cause weapons to
rust extremely fast.)
```
```
Can summon forest elementals
Please note that the amount of wins exceeding the CL will determine how long
the elemental will remain in the physical plane.
```
```
Matching the CL = One round
+1 over the CL= three rounds
+2 over the CL= ten rounds
+3 over the CL = One hour
+4 over the CL = six hours
+5 over the CL = a day
+6 over the CL = Will say with the Sorcerer until dismissed
```
```

remain in the world for the equivalent amount of losses under the CL as wins over
the CL determines.

elemental based attacks, magic attacks and receive double damage from
attacks by fire. When elementals are struck by a damage type that can harm
them, they receive damaged in the same way as any other creature and
character, meaning in injury severity from combat maneuvers.
```

**Reflection**

```
Can pass on properties such as injury, poison or strength to another person
Heal (not nearly as potent as holy magic but does work to an extent.)
Rotten food will become good again, old weathered wood renewed. It
essentially turns back time for a specific object. This can also make a person more
youthful)
Cause to sleep, make sick, feel healthy. Never permanent and cannot kill.
```
**Communion**

```
Can speak with any living thing and ask for their help. The CL will reflect the level
of help being requested.

```
```
Exultation
Walk through walls or on water or air

## Part 2 – Random Encounters

These charts are mainly for use by the narrator of the Campaign and can be adapted to other
genres, but are in this case based around the classic Medieval Fantast genre.

With any encounter there is still room to move. They can be small or severe in their fulfillment.
With each encounter a severity roll must accompany it to determine how extreme or mild it is.
This applies to weather and monsters and is done with a D6

```
Severity roll
o 1 - 2 Mild
o 3 - 4 Average
o 5 - 6 heavy
```
```
Weather
There are two rolls for a weather check. The first is according to the following weather
charts on a 1d100 (two d10 dice). The second is a severity check, is it drizzling or heavy
rain?
The weather check should last for about two days but you can have them last for one
day or a week, it’s your choice but two days represents the most realistic weather
conditions. A new weather roll every day could represent turbulent weather conditions
at that time in the game.
The severity check determines the severity of the weather for that day. The severity
check should be done every day in the game.
```
```
The following charts represent a mild climate. If the players are based in or travel to a
different climate such as a desert or a mountain peak, add 10 to 20 on the 1d100
weather roll if the climate is hotter (10 to 20 because a desert is different to the tropics,
both hotter but different to each other) and subtract 10 to 20 if the climate is colder.
The natural disaster result only applies if it is a natural 100 roll. If the characters are in a
hotter climate and 10 is added to the weather roll, the natural disaster result only applies
if a natural 100 was rolled, if 100 was achieved by adding to the roll, it is effectively 99,
```

```
not 100. Likewise if the characters are in a colder climate and a 100 was rolled, the
subtraction doesn’t count and the result is natural disaster regardless.
```
```
Note; snow lasts much longer than any other weather condition, especially if the
weather is cold. If snow was a result of a weather roll, and the following roll is cold, the
snow remains on the ground.
